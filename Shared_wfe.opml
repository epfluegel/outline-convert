          <outline text="Executive Summary">
            <outline text="This project aimed to translate a PDF document of a Czech mathematical paper into English, so it can be used for research. What we did was first gathering the text in Czech without taking into account mathematical formulae because they can be understood independently of any language. To do so, we used OCR libraries available in Python 3 to gather the text and then we used ChatGPT to both translate and format the result. Along this project we succeeded in translating the text accurately and also, beyond our expectations, we also managed to convert the entire document to LaTeX, even though the mathematical formulae are not always accurate. In the end the main goal is fulfilled and the Latex version could be slightly improved so that we surpass the main goal." />

            <outline text="The aim of the project was to investigate how to convert scientific paper written in a foreign language to English using AI tools, and also how to convert between pdf and other scientific markup languages. The following objectives were accomplished:" />

            <outline text="Robust error handling was added to handle OCR failures and keep the process running (e.g when a block was too small)." />
            <outline text="5. Parallelization:" />
            <outline text="We used a multiprocessing pool to speed up math OCR by handling multiple blocks in parallel." />

            <outline text="The text file was given to chat gpt and he was able to translate it in english and to recognize maths formulas that have just been translated in simple text. It then gave me a Latex file." />

              <outline text="The strategy was changed along the way because trying to do the ocr for both text and maths formulas and at the same time make it a Latex file was too much. It needed too much time and computing power. Luckily AI was able make it real which surpassed the original goal that was just tintrandlate the text." />

            <outline text="Further work">
              <outline text="It could be great to also recognize maths formulas with ocr but the main goal is to translate the text because the formulas are already readable." />
