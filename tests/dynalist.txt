                 __Motive__: the underlying reason for attacking the victim. 
                     This could be for the purposes of financial gains, revenge, personal satisfaction or thrill, or simply with the intention of creating damage. From a psychological point of view, the attacker's motive might affect the perceived gain, as well as the appreciation of the effort required.
                 __Ability__: the capability of the attacker to invest in resources for implementing the attack, as well as the technical knowledge available for breaching cyber security controls. 
                     A strong ability will make it easier to spend effort on the attack, and subjectively reducing the perceived value of $e$.
                 __Exploitability__: the ease by which the system can be penetrated, through exploiting a vulnerability. 
                     It would be reasonable to expect exploitability and effort to be inversely related in a proportional manner. This category could be explored similarly as in the CVSS exploitability score, taking into account possible attack vectors and attack complexities, as well as the required privileges and interaction with users, however, the discussion should not be restricted to software vulnerabilities alone.
                 __Visibility of target__: how prominent is the target, for example, does it have a popular website or brand name, does it have a large user base? 
                     Great visibility might promise a big gain, in the eyes of the attacker.
                 __Attractiveness of target__: from the point of view of the attacker, how attractive is the target? 
                     This is linked to how much gain the attacker would estimate from achieving through the attack, and will strongly depend on the specific motive, as discussed in the first category.

                     The Dual Simplex Method 
                     MC2 Linear Programs
                 MC2 Linear Program Formulation #slide 
                     MC2 LP:
                         Consider
                             "$$\max C^\top y+d$$" subject to "$$Ay\le B$$" and $$y\ge 0$$ ($$d>0$$). 
                         This means
                             $$\exist\, x,y^0\ge 0:\; z=x(C^\top y + d)$$ maximal s.t. $$Ay \le By^o,\; y\ge 0$$.

                             Multiple objectives: $$C$$
                             Multiple constraints: $$B$$
                 Necessary Conditions: Augmented Form #slide 
                     We view the linear system of inequalities used in the MC2 LP as a system of linear matrix equations.
                     This can be written using non-basic and basic variables as
                         $$Ay+\hat{y}=By^o$$
                         $$x^o(C^\top y+d)=v$$
                     where $$y\ge 0,\hat{y}\ge 0,y^o\ge 0$$.
                 Constructing A Basic Solution #slide 
                     We can construct a basic solution that may be infeasible, or not even real, given as follows:
                         Let $$\lambda\neq 0$$ be an eigenvalue of $$D$$ with corresponding eigenvectors $$\hat{x}^\top, \hat{y}$$ and define $$\hat{v}=1/\lambda$$. 
                         Subject to the substitution $$A\leftarrow A+aD$$ for a suitable positive real number $$a$$ we can assume $$\Re(\hat{v})>0$$. 
                         Then $$(\hat{v},\hat{x}^\top, \hat{y})$$ is a generalised eigensystem of $$I-\lambda{D}$$. 
                         Set $$x^o=\hat{x}B$$, $$y=0$$, $$v=x^od$$ and $$y^o=C^\top \hat{y}$$.

                             The algorithm views the linear system of equations used in the dual simplex method as a bilinear linear matrix pencil equation. 
                             This can be written using non-basic and basic variables as
                                 $$x^\top(A-vD)y+\hat{x}\hat{y}=0$$
                                     $$x^\top(A-vD)y+\hat{x}^\top(I-\hat{v}{D})\hat{y}=0$$ #wfe-ignore-item

                                     $$x^\top(A-vbc^\top)y+\hat{x}^\top(\alpha I-{\beta}{bc^\top})\hat{y}=0$$

                             Assumptions
                                 The matrix pencil $$A-\lambda {bc^\top}$$ is regular.
                                 The unique finite eigenvalue of this regular matrix pencil is positive. 
                                 Note: this excludes the case where $$bc^\top$$ is nilpotent.

                         Initialisation #slide #simplex:init 
                             We start with $$x=y=0$$, $$v=0$$ and a basic solution that may be infeasible, given as follows:
                                 Let $$\lambda\neq 0$$ be an eigenvalue of $$D$$ with corresponding eigenvectors $$\hat{x}^\top, \hat{y}$$ and define $$\hat{v}=1/\lambda$$. 
                                 Then $$(\hat{v},\hat{x}^\top, \hat{y})$$ is a generalised eigensystem of $$I-\lambda{D}$$. 
                                 Subject to the substitution $$A\leftarrow A+aD$$ for a suitable real number $$a$$ we can assume $$\hat{v}>0$$. 
                         Reduction Step (I) #slide #simplex:pivot 
                             We partition the matrix $$A$$ into $$rs$$ blocks ($$1\le r \le m$$, $$1\le s \le n$$), with matching row and column dimensions:
                                 $$A=\begin{pmatrix} A_{11} & \cdots & A_{1j} & \cdots & A_{1s} \\ \vdots &  & \vdots &  & \vdots \\ A_{i1} & \cdots & A_{ij} & \cdots & A_{is} \\ \vdots &  & \vdots &  & \vdots \\A_{r1} & \cdots & A_{rj} & \cdots & A_{rs} \\ \end{pmatrix}$$
                             Let $$B$$ and $$C^\top$$ be partitioned accordingly
                             We can pick a block-index pair $$(i,j)$$ as block-pivot, if $$A_{ij}$$ is square and $$A_{ij}-\lambda B_{ij}C_{ij}^\top$$ is a regular matrix pencil with at least one real, positive eigenvalue $$\mu$$ and corresponding eigenvectors $$x^\top_\mu, y_\mu$$ that are not both nonnegative

                                 The new matrices $$\tilde{A}$$ and $$\tilde{B}$$ are obtained through left-multiplication of a suitable matrix $$P$$ and swapping basic and non-basic variables

                                 The new matrices $$\tilde{A}$$ and $$\tilde{C}$$ are obtained through right-multiplication of a suitable matrix $$Q$$ and swapping basic and non-basic variables

                         Consider the model VNM($$D,A$$) where $$D=BC^\top \geqq 0$$.
                         We refer to this as a rank-1 VN model.
                         It is known in the literature \cite{Bidard2000-jr}, that such a model is equivalent to a linear program.
                         Theorem: the rank-one model VNM($$uv^\top,A$$) with maximal growth factor $$\lambda>0$$ is equivalent to the linear program LP($$v^\top, A, u$$) with optimal value $$\lambda^{-1}$$. #theorem

                             We start with $$\lambda$$ maximal such that $$\exists x,y\in \R^{n}: x^\top(A-\lambda UV^\top)\geqq 0$$.
                             Define $$\tilde{X} := \lambda^{-1} {(X^\top U)}^{-1}X^\top$$.
                             Then $$\tilde{X}u=\frac{X^\top U}{\lambda X^\top U}=\lambda^{-1}$$ is minimal, such that $$\tilde{X}^\top(A-\lambda UV^\top)=\tilde{X}^\top A-V^\top \geqq 0$$.
                             This means that the multi-linear multi-criteria program MLC($$U, A, V^\top$$) is solved by $$\tilde{X}^\top$$ with value $$\lambda^{-1}$$.
                         "$$\Longleftarrow$$" 
                             Assume $${X}^\top$$ is a solution of the multi-linear multi-criteria program MLC($$U, A, V^\top$$) with value $$\mu^{}$$.
                             This means $$\mu := X^\top u$$ is minimal such that $$X^\top A-V^\top\geqq 0$$.
                             One has $$V^\top=(X^\top U)^{-1}X^\top UV^\top = \mu^{-1}X^\top UV^\top \geqq 0$$. 
                             Hence $$X^\top(A-\mu^{-1} UV^\top)\geqq 0$$ and $$\lambda:=\mu^{-1}$$ is a maximal growth factor for VNM($$UV^\top,A$$).

                     Introduction #slide
                         Background:
                             The concept of a Blockchain has experienced a tremendous interest, ever since the inception of Bitcoin as a pioneering Blockchain application
                         Context:
                             Kindly, there is a huge debate whether Blockchains will eventually become mainstream applications
                         Motivation:
                             There are some crucial aspects of mainstream Blockchain systems, that require addressing
                         Summary:
                             use of innovative cryptographic techniques with a focus on secret sharing and steganography
                     Aims and Research Questions #slide 
                         This line of research aims to improve the security and dependability of blockchain architectures by addressing scalability, storage requirements, performance and refinements of the mainstream security goals of confidentiality, integrity and availability. 
                         A central research question is how to use cryptographic techniques other than encryption, to add features and improve the above-mentioned aspects for blockchain architectures that are not met by mainstream implementations. 
                     Challenges #slide 
                         The main challenge in this research domain is creating practical impact based on implementations suitable for real-world deployment. 
                         Another challenge is to find poignant blockchain applications compatible with proposed prototype security architectures, offering functionality for novel use cases. 
                     Outlook #slide 
                         At this point, further diversification of additional cryptographic schemes proposed for the use for the blockchain is expected. 
                         However, it is unclear when these initiatives will substantially and positively impact current mainstream systems. 
                         Still, a clear potential exists, which will continue to motivate researchers in this area to put their efforts into ongoing projects.

                             Introduced by Jacobson (1937) as a unifying framework for linear differential and difference equations/systems

                         Concepts #slide 
                             We need some notations:
                                 $$F$$ a field
                                 $$\phi$$ a $$K$$-automorphism of $$F$$
                                 $$\delta$$ a pseudo-derivation w.r.t. $$\phi$$, i.e.
                                     $$\delta(fg) = \delta f \phi g + f\delta g$$
                             One can show: if $$\phi \neq \text{id}$$, then $$\exists \gamma \in F: \delta = \gamma(\phi - \text{id})$$.
                                 
                     Systems of Pseudo-Linear Equations #h 
                         Introduction #slide 
                             System of Pseudo-Linear Equations:
                                 $$\delta Y(\tau) = A(\tau) \phi Y(\tau)$$
                             with $$A \in F^{n \times n}$$. This unifies common types of linear functional equations.
                             If $$\phi \neq \text{id}$$, the system can be represented in different formats:
                                 $$\phi Y(\tau) = A(\tau) Y(\tau)$$
                             or
                                 $$\delta Y(\tau) = A(\tau) Y(\tau)$$.
                             Conversions between formats can be done efficiently.

                                 Ultimate aim: efficiently compute symbolic solutions of systems of linear functional equations.
                                 Objectives:
                                     To give a unifying theoretical framework for defining irregular parts of formal solutions.
                                     To provide a generic algorithm that can compute irregular parts efficiently.
                                 This is joint work with M. Barkatou and G. Broughton.

                                             $$v: F\longrightarrow \Z\cup\{\infty\}$$ a valuation defined by

                                         Also assume $$v(\phi(f)) = v(f) \;\;\;\forall f \in F$$. 
                                         A singular system of pseudo-linear equations is:
                                             $$\tau^{r-\omega}\delta Y(\tau) = A(\tau) \phi Y(\tau)$$
                                         with $$r \in \N$$ (the \emph{Poincar\'{e}-rank}) and $$A \in K[[\tau]]^{n \times n}$$.

                                         We define the quantities $$c, q \in K^{\ast}$$ from the definition of $$\phi$$ and $$\delta$$:

                                         We then have inductively for $$h \in \N^{+}$$

                         A Best Response Lemma #slide 
                             The proof of the theorem will be aided by the following lemma. 
                             It exhibits a special case arising where there exists a strategy of one player to which any strategy of the other player is a best response.
                             #lemma:best-response-eigen
                                 Following the notations as in the theorem, we have for a nonnegative left eigenvector $$x_{\mu_B}$$ that for all Player 2 strategies $$y$$ it holds $$x^\top_{\mu_B} B y = \mu_B $$. Similarly, a nonnegative right eigenvector $$y_{\mu_A}$$ satisfies $$x^\top A y_{\mu_A} = \mu_A$$ for all Player 1 strategies $$x$$.
                                 Using set notation, $$ \mathcal{BR}(y_{\mu_A})=X$$ and $$ \mathcal{BR}(x_{\mu_B})=Y$$.
                         Proof [of lemma] #slide 
                             #proof 
                                 Assume that $$x^{\top}_{\mu_A}\ge 0$$ is a left eigenvector, associated with the eigenvalue $${\mu_A}$$ of the regular matrix pencil $$A-\lambda E$$. This implies
                                 #equation:left-nullspace-eq
                                      $$ x^{\top}_{\mu_A}(A-{\mu_A} E)=0. $$
                                 Due to the normalisation property $$\sum x_{{\mu_A},i}=1$$ we have $$ x^{\top}_{\mu_A} E = x^{\top}_{\mu_A} ee^{\top}=e^{\top}$$ so that equation #ref:left-nullspace-eq implies 
                                     $$ x^{\top}_{\mu_A} A = {\mu_A} e^{\top}$$.  #displaymaths 
                                 The second property for a right eigenvector $$y_{\mu_B}$$ can be shown similarly. From this, the lemma follows. 
                         Proof [of Theorem #ref:bimatrix-regular-theorem ] #slide 
                             Let $$y_{\mu_A}$$ be nonnegative right eigenvector of $$A-\lambda E$$ with respect to the eigenvalue $$\mu_A$$. From Lemma #ref:best-response-lemma we deduce that $$y_{\mu_A}$$ is a best response to any Player 1 strategy $$x$$, in particular to  $$x=x_{\mu_B}$$. Likewise,  denote $$x_{\mu_B}$$ a nonnegative left eigenvector of $$B-\lambda E$$. We obtain that  $$x_{\mu_B}$$ is a best response to Player 2 strategy $$y=y_{\mu_A}$$. Hence these strategies are mutual best responses and by definition mixed Nash Equilibrium strategies with payoffs $$\mu_A$$ and $$\mu_B$$ as required. #proof

                         The fundamental relationship between generalised eigensystems associated with a bimatrix game --- under the assumption of certain sufficient conditions --- and an equilibrium strategy of the game is established in this section. 
                         This extends results by @THOMPSON to bimatrix games. 
                         #theorem:bimatrix-regular-theorem
                             Given a square bimatrix game $$G=(A,B)$$, assume the matrix pencils $$A-\lambda E$$  and $$B-\lambda E$$ are both regular, each with a real generalised eigenvalue $$\mu_A$$ and $$\mu_B$$ respectively. Let $$x_{\mu_B}$$ be a nonnegative left generalised eigenvector of $$B-\lambda E$$ with respect to $$\mu_B$$ and denote $$y_{\mu_A}$$ a nonnegative right generalised eigenvector of $$A-\lambda E$$ with respect to $$\mu_A$$. Then $$(x^*,y^*) = (x_{\mu_B}$$, $$y_{\mu_A}$$) is a Nash Equilibrium strategy profile of the game $$G$$ and $$(\mu_A, \mu_B)$$ is the corresponding game value pair.
                         The proof of the theorem will be aided by the following lemma. It exhibits a special case arising where there exists a strategy of one player to which any strategy of the other player is a best response.
                         #lemma:best-response
                             Following the notations as in the theorem, we have for a nonnegative left generalised eigenvector $$x_{\mu_B}$$ that for all Player 2 strategies $$y$$ it holds $$x^\top_{\mu_B} B y = \mu_B $$. Similarly, a nonnegative right generalised eigenvector $$y_{\mu_A}$$ satisfies $$x^\top A y_{\mu_A} = \mu_A$$ for all Player 1 strategies $$x$$.
                         #proof 
                             Assume that $$x^{\top}_{\mu_A}\ge 0$$ is a left generalised eigenvector, associated with the generalised eigenvalue $${\mu_A}$$ of the regular matrix pencil $$A-\lambda E$$. This implies
                             #equation:left-nullspace-eq
                                  $$ x^{\top}_{\mu_A}(A-{\mu_A} E)=0. $$
                             Due to the normalisation property $$\sum x_{{\mu_A},i}=1$$ we have $$ x^{\top}_{\mu_A} E = x^{\top}_{\mu_A} ee^{\top}=e^{\top}$$ so that equation #ref:left-nullspace-eq implies 
                                 $$ x^{\top}_{\mu_A} A = {\mu_A} e^{\top}$$.  #displaymaths 
                             The second property for a right generalised eigenvector $$y_{\mu_B}$$ can be shown similarly. From this, the lemma follows. 
                         The proof of Theorem #bimatrix-regular-theorem.ref can now be stated as follows. 
                         #proof
                             Let $$y_{\mu_A}$$ be nonnegative right generalised eigenvector of $$A-\lambda E$$ with respect to the generalised eigenvalue $$\mu_A$$. From Lemma #ref:best-response-lemma we deduce that $$y_{\mu_A}$$ is a best response to any Player 1 strategy $$x$$, in particular to  $$x=x_{\mu_B}$$. Likewise,  denote $$x_{\mu_B}$$ a nonnegative left generalised eigenvector of $$B-\lambda E$$. We obtain that  $$x_{\mu_B}$$ is a best response to Player 2 strategy $$y=y_{\mu_A}$$. Hence these strategies are mutual best responses and by definition mixed Nash Equilibrium strategies with payoffs $$\mu_A$$ and $$\mu_B$$ as required. #proof

                     The Completely Mixed Case #h 
                         The use of generalised eigensystems to characterise a completely mixed equilibrium strategy turns out to be a natural approach, as suggested by the following
                         #theorem:bimatrix-weakly-mixed
                             A bimatrix game is weakly completely mixed iff its associated generalised eigensystems $$\mathcal{E}_A$$ and $$\mathcal{E}_B$$ are both regular, with corresponding real generalised eigenvalues $$\mu_A$$ and $$\mu_B$$ respectively, and strictly positive right generalised eigenvector $$y_{\mu_A}$$ (left generalised eigenvector $$x_{\mu_B}$$ respectively). 
                         #proof
                             __The conditions are necessary.__  This shall be proven in a number of steps. 
                                 The following theorem is a refinement of Raghavan's results, establish additional properties of the adjoints of the game matrices. 
                                     #theorem:cofactors 
                                         If a bimatrix game is completely mixed and $$v_A=0$$, the cofactors $$A_{i1},\ldots,A_{in}$$ of the matrix $$A$$ are either all zero or all have the same sign, for any $$1\le i\le n$$. If $$v_B=0$$, the same property holds for the cofactors $$B_{1j},\ldots,B_{nj}$$ of the matrix $$B$$, for all $$1\le j\le n$$. 
                                     #proof 
                                         The proof is based on [Raghavan, Theorem 4], using a technique similar to that in the proof for [Kaplanski, Theorem 4].
                                         The result will be proven for $$B$$ and $$v_B$$, the statements for $$A$$ and $$v_A$$ can be done in an analog fashion.
                                             Let $$x$$ be an equilibrium strategy for the second player and assume $$v_{B} = 0$$. Then for $$j\in 1\ldots n$$ one has
                                                 $$\sum_{i=1}^n x_ia_{ij}=0$$.
                                             On the other hand, expanding the determinant using column $$j$$ it holds
                                                 $$0=\det A=\sum_{i=1}^n a_{ij}A_{ij}$$.
                                             Raghavan has shown that a completely mixed bimatrix game with both values zero, the rank of the game matrices is $$n-1$$ and the equilibrium strategy is unique.
                                             Since the equilibrium strategy is unique and $$rank A = n-1$$, these two linear combinations must be unique up to multiplication with a constant. This yields
                                                 $$\frac{x_1}{A_{1j}} = \frac{x_2}{A_{2j}} = \cdots = \frac{x_n}{A_{nj}}$$
                                             So these cofactors have same sign or are all zero.
                                             Then show that sum of adjoints is not zero:
                                                 if it was zero, then $$c_A(\lambda)\equiv 0$$ 
                                                 for a unique completely mixed equilibrium solution $$(x,y)$$ 
                                                 Since $$rk(A)=n-1$$ it follows $$A^*=
                                 For a regular matrix pencil $$A-\lambda E$$, define the __generalised characteristic polynomial__ $$c_A(\lambda):=\det(A-\lambda E)$$. It will be shown to be a polynomial of degree at the most one. 
                                     #lemma:charpoly 
                                         The generalised characteristic polynomial is a linear function $$c_A(\lambda)=c_0-c_1\lambda$$ where $$c_0=\det A$$ and $$c_1=e^t A^*e = \sum_{ij}A_{ij}$$ with $$A_{ij}$$ denoting the cofactor of $$a_{ij}$$.  
                                     This identity has already been used but not proven in @KAPLANSKI. 
                                     A full proof can be found in @KARLIN [A.9], however for convenience to the reader a different and short elementary proof is given here, based on a generalisation to regular matrix pencils of @MILCHTAICH .
                                     #proof 
                                         Consider the square matrix pencil of order $$n+1$$
                                             $$\hat{A}=\begin{pmatrix} A &\lambda e\\- e^t &0\end{pmatrix} $$. 
                                         The determinant of $$\hat{A}$$ can be computed in two different ways. First, use Laplace expansion by the last row to obtain 
                                             $$\det \hat{A} =\sum_{j=1}^n(-1)^{n+j}\det \left( [A]_{j}|\lambda e\right) $$. 
                                         Applying one more Laplace expansion along column $$n$$ in the augmented matrices yields
                                             $$\det \left( [A]_{j}|\lambda e\right)=\sum_{i=1}^n(-1)^{i+n}\det {}_i[A]_{j}\cdot \lambda $$. 
                                         Combining these steps, one has
                                             $$\det \hat{A}= \sum_{i,j=1}^n(-1)^{i+j}\det {}_i[A]_{j}\cdot \lambda =\sum_{i,j} A_{ij}\cdot \lambda      $$. 
                                         On the other hand, rewriting the initial matrix as
                                             $$\hat{A} = \begin{pmatrix} A &0+\lambda e\\-e^t &1-1\end{pmatrix} $$
                                         and applying the linearity of the determinant w.r.t. the last column, it follows
                                             $$\det \hat{A} =\det \begin{pmatrix} A &0\\-e^t &1\end{pmatrix} -\det \begin{pmatrix} A &-\lambda e\\-e^t &1\end{pmatrix} =\det A-\det \begin{pmatrix} A-\lambda E &-\lambda e\\ 0 &1\end{pmatrix} =\det A-\det (A-\lambda E) $$.
                                         The second equality 
                                         Finally combining these results finishes the proof:
                                             $$\det (A-\lambda E) = \det A-\sum_{i,j} A_{ij}\cdot \lambda$$.

                                                 Furthermore, since the degree of $$c_A$$ is bound by rank($$E)=1$$, it is sufficient to consider a linear polynomial and one obtains $$c_A(\lambda)=\det A+ c_1\lambda$$.
                                                 Using a column $$j\in \{1,\ldots,n\}$$, and considering the Laplace expansion of the determinant 
                                                     $$\det (A-\lambda E)=\sum_{i = 1}^{n}(-1)^{i+j}(a_{ij}-\lambda)\det({[A]}_{i,j}-\lambda E).$$ #det-label #displaymath
                                                 the lemma can be applied inductively to the above matrix minor pencil of order $$n-1$$
                                                     $$\det([{A}]_{i,j}-\lambda E)=\det[{A}]_{i,j}-\sum_{k,l}^{n}A_{\{i,k\}\{j,l \}} \cdot \lambda$$.
                                                 Using this in #det-label:ref and expanding, one obtains a polynomial in $$\lambda$$ which is known to be linear, and by comparing coefficients one obtains
                                                     $$ c_1 = \sum_{i=1}^n(-1)^{i+j}\det[{A}]_{i,j} +\sum_{i=1}^n(-1)^{i+j}a_{ij}\det[{A}]_{i,j}=\sum_{i=1}^nA_{ij}+s_{j}$$.
                                                 It remains to show that the term $$s_j$$ consists of the remaining sum of cofactors $$A_{il}$$ for $$l\neq j$$.
                                                 This can be seen by exchanging the order of summation in
                                                     $$s_{j}= \sum_{i=1}^n(-1)^{i+j}a_{ij}\det([{A}]_{i,j})$$
                                                     $$=\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{k=1}^n\sum_{l=1}^n (-1)^{i+j+\sigma_i(k)+\sigma_j(l)}a_{ij}\det([A]_{\{i,k \}\{j,l \}})  $$ ($$k\neq i,\; l\neq j$$)
                                                     $$=\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{l=1}^n\sum_{k=1}^n (-1)^{i+j+\sigma_i(k)+\sigma_j(l)}a_{ij}\det(A_{\{i,k \}\{j,l \}})  $$ ($$k\neq i,\; l\neq j$$).
                                                 Swapping index notations $$i,k$$ and $$l,j$$ one obtains
                                                     $$s_l=\sum_{k=1}^n\sum_{l=1}^n\sum_{i=1}^{n}(-1)^{k+l+\sigma_k(i)+\sigma_l(j)}{a}_{ij}\det [A]_{\{k,i \}\{l,j \}}  $$ ($$i\neq k,\; j\neq l$$)

                                 Finally, the proof follows directly from Lemma #lemma:cofactors:ref and #lemma:charpoly:ref as the regularity of the pencil and the properties of the generalised eigenvectors are established. 
                             __The conditions are sufficient.__ This follows directly from Theorem #theorem:bimatrix-regular-theorem:ref yielding a completely mixed equlibrium strategy pair from the strictly positive generalised eigenvectors.
                     Related Work #h 
                         In summary, the purely game-theoretical results of this paper show that the use of generalised eigensystems is a natural approach when focussing on completely mixed equilibrium solutions of bimatrix games. 
                         Adapting the work of @THOMPSON to bimatrix games, the line of research initiated by @RAMAGHAN is led to a satisfying next level. Furthermore, some closely related results of @MILCHTAICH can be stated more naturally. The results on the relationship between inactive strategies, generalised eigenvalues and strategic dominance, first given by @WEIL for matrix games, appear to be novel in the bimatrix game setting. 
                         LIMITATIONS
                             At first glance, a limitation of this work appears to be the restriction to square bimatrix games. On the other hand, as shown in [], any non-square bimatrix game has inactive strategies and hence does not have completely mixed equilibrium strategies. 
                             It would be interesting to combine existing methods for solving non-square bimatrix games with the approach of this section and to investigate resulting advantages.

                                 Focusing on the single software asset that contains a vulnerability, we define a __single-target small security game__ in normal form through the following payoff matrix
                                 $$\begin{array}{ | c | c | c | }  \mathcal{D} \downarrow \mathcal{A}\rightarrow & s_a & s_{-{a}} \\ s_d &  - c^{\mathcal{D}}, - c^{\mathcal{A}}&  -c^{\mathcal{D}},  0 \\  s_{-{d}} &  -l^{\mathcal{D}},  l^{\mathcal{D}}- c^{\mathcal{A}} &  0,  0 \end{array}$$  #normal
                                 where the rows correspond to the pure strategies available to the defender $$\mathcal{D}$$ and the columns are the attacker's pure strategies. Here  we assume that the attacker's benefit equals the loss of the defender. 
                                 This game has been studied in the past (see e.g. \cite{@Samarji2015}) and is suitable for our scenario which is based on a single asset vulnerability assessment. It is not the specialisation of a big security game.
                                 The following assumption seem reasonable in a realistic setup:

                             Game Analysis #slide 
                                 The analysis of this presented security game is not difficult, it can be shown that there are no pure Nash equilibrium strategies as [..] and hence a closed-form expression exists \cite{} for determining the values $$p^{*} = \frac{c^{\mathcal{A}}}{l^{\mathcal{D}}} = 1 - \frac{c^{\mathcal{A}}}{l^{\mathcal{D}}}$$ and $$q^{*} = \frac{c^{\mathcal{D}}}{l^{\mathcal{D}}}$$ forming a mixed Nash equilibrium strategy $$(s_D^{*}, s_A^{*})$$ where $$p^*$$ and $$q^*$$ are the probability of defense and attack respectively. 
                                 This will be the underlying method to compute our attack likelihood in this scenario, based on $$q^*$$.
                                 One verifies that the expected utilities in this case are $$ u_D^{*} = -c^{\mathcal{D}} $$ and $$ u_A^{*} = 0 $$.
                                 [TODO: derive these results by applying the algebraic framework from the previous section]
                                 Issues: complete info problematic; attacker needs to know defense cost and loss; defender needs to know attack cost;
                         2. Add CVSS metrics to the utility functions #h
                             Move to CVSS #slide 
                                 We  now use CVSS to specify the payoff functions of the single-target security game of the previous section.  
                                 To achieve this aim, we will use the CVSS impact and exploitability sub-scores. 
                                 Our aim is only use this publicly available scoring data, as we are assuming a complete information game.
                             Approach #slide 
                                 The loss for the defender is due to the attack impact, which will be modelled as a function of the CVSS impact sub-score: $$l^{\mathcal{D}} =f({\mu}_{Imp})$$. 
                                 Furthermore we assume that the defender applies the principle of adequate protection [@pfleeger] by investing an amount for defence that is proportional to the loss: $$c^{\mathcal{D}} \sim f({\mu}_{Imp})$$ where $$f$$ is linear. 
                                 The attack cost depends on the CVSS exploitability subscore, taking into account that high score values indicate a vulnerability that is easy to exploit: $$c^{\mathcal{A}} = g({\mu_{Exp}})$$.

                                 We start with the following game:
                                 $$\begin{array}{ | c | c | c | } \mathcal{D} \downarrow \mathcal{A}\rightarrow & a& \overline{a} \\ d &?,?& ?, 0 \\ \overline{d} &? ,?& 0, 0 \end{array}$$ #normal

                                 We obtain the following game normal form:
                                 $$\begin{array}{ c | c | c } \mathcal{D} \downarrow \mathcal{A}\rightarrow & a& \overline{a} \\ \hline d & - \mu_{Imp},  {\mu}_{Exp}-10& -\mu_{Imp}, 0 \\ \hline\overline{d} & -{\mu}_{Imp}, {\mu}_{Imp}+10- {\mu}_{Exp} & 0, 0 \end{array}$$

                         Throughout this section we assume that there is a software asset $$s$$ with a vulnerability $$v$$. 
                         We denote by $$S_{\mathcal{D}}=\{d,\overline{d}\}$$ the strategy set of the Defender, where $$d$$ corresponds to the strategy that the Defender patches $$v$$ and $$\overline{d}$$ corresponds to the strategy that the Defender does not patch $$v$$. Likewise, the strategy set of the Attacker is given by $$S_{\mathcal{A}}=\{a,\overline{a}\}$$, where $$a$$ corresponds to the strategy of the Attacker to exploit $$v$$ and $$\overline{a}$$ that the Attacker does not attempt to exploit $$v$$) respectively, e.g. by running some malware. To patch the vulnerability, we assume that there is an associate cost, $$c^{\mathcal{D}}$$ for the Defender. To exploit vulnerability $$v$$, we assume that there is a cost $$c^{\mathcal{A}}$$ for the Attacker and a benefit $$b^{\mathcal{A}}$$. We assume that this benefit matches a loss $$l^{\mathcal{D}} = b^{\mathcal{A}}$$ for the Attacker. % #gamesec
                     CVSS Game
                         Example: Case Study 2 #slide 
                             The analysis of the previous game can be used for the vulnerability patching scenario.
                             The goal is to find realistic values for the game payoff parameters $$l^D$$ and $$c^A$$.
                             This could be done for example using the __Common Vulnerability Scoring System__ (CVSS).
                             Information about the severity of the vulnerability is publicly available online.
                         Case Study 2 (continued) #slide 
                             The attacker's cost $$c^A$$ is proportional to the inverse of the CVSS __exploitability subscore__:
                                 $$c^A = \alpha \cdot {\mu_{E}}^{-1} $$.
                                 Here, $$\alpha$$ is a constant that needs to be suitably defined.
                             The loss of the defender $$l^D$$ is due to a threat event impact, exploiting the vulnerability and affecting the asset's CIA security requirements.
                             Using the CVSS impact subscore, a vector $$V$$ with numerical components is defined, depending on the security criticality of the asset. 
                                 This yields $$l^D =   \mu_{Imp, C} \cdot V_C + \mu_{Imp, I} \cdot V_I + \mu_{Imp, A} \cdot V_A$$.
                             Finally, by plugging this into the game solutions, a recommendation can be made for the decision to patch the vulnerability.
                     Vulnerability patch Narrative #wfe-ignore-outline 
                         We denote by $$S_{\mathcal{D}}=\{d,\overline{d}\}$$ the strategy set of the Defender, where $$d$$ corresponds to the strategy that the Defender patches $$v$$ and $$\overline{d}$$ corresponds to the strategy that the Defender does not patch $$v$$. Likewise, the strategy set of the Attacker is given by $$S_{\mathcal{A}}=\{a,\overline{a}\}$$, where $$a$$ corresponds to the strategy of the Attacker to exploit $$v$$ and $$\overline{a}$$ that the Attacker does not attempt to exploit $$v$$) respectively, e.g. by running some malware. 
                         To patch the vulnerability, we assume that there is an associate cost, $$c^{\mathcal{D}}$$ for the Defender. To exploit vulnerability $$v$$, we assume that there is a cost $$c^{\mathcal{A}}$$ for the Attacker and a benefit $$b^{\mathcal{A}}$$. We assume that this benefit matches a loss $$l^{\mathcal{D}} = b^{\mathcal{A}}$$ for the Attacker. % #gamesec
                         This game has been studied in the past (see e.g. \cite{@Samarji2015}) and is suitable for our scenario which is based on a single asset vulnerability assessment. It is not the specialisation of a big security game. 
                         Focusing on the single software asset that contains a vulnerability, we define a \emph{single-target small security game}  in normal form through the following payoff matrix $$\begin{array}{ | c | c | c | } \hline {\mathcal{D}} \downarrow {\mathcal{A}} \rightarrow & a & \overline{a} \\ \hline d &  - c^{\mathcal{D}}, - c^{\mathcal{A}} &  -c^{\mathcal{D}},  0 \\ \hline \overline{d} &  -l^{\mathcal{D}},  l^{\mathcal{D}}- c^{\mathcal{A}} &  0,  0 \\ \hline \end{array}$$where the rows correspond to the pure strategies available to the defender $${\mathcal{D}}$$ and the columns are the attacker's $${\mathcal{A}}$$ pure strategies. Here  we assume that the attacker's benefit equals the loss of the defender.

                                 Black hat hackers are criminals who act with malicious intent.
                                 Their motivation is often financial gain or revenge.
                                     They may also release malware that destroys files, holds computers hostage, or steals personal information.
                                     Black hats spread havoc wherever they go, often causing serious damage to individuals and organizations alike.
                                 Sometimes they target people they strongly disagree with for ideological reasons.
                             Slide Title: Gray Hat Hackers
                                 Gray hat hackers engage in a mix of both black and white hat activities.
                                 They may look for system vulnerabilities without permission or knowledge from the owner, and may report any issues found to the owner for a small fee.
                                 Gray hats may sometimes violate laws or ethical standards but usually lack the malicious intent of black hat hackers.
                                 They may believe they are doing good for companies by hacking into their systems, but owners rarely appreciate unauthorized access to their business information infrastructure.
                                 Often, the real intention of gray hats is to showcase their skills and gain publicity and recognition for contributing to cybersecurity.
                             Slide Title: Definition of a White Hat Hacker
                                 A white hat hacker is a computer security expert who specializes in finding vulnerabilities in systems and networks.
                                 Unlike black hat hackers, white hat hackers use their skills for ethical and lawful purposes, such as testing and improving the security of computer systems and networks.
                                 White hat hackers may be hired by organizations to conduct penetration testing or vulnerability assessments to identify potential weaknesses in their systems.
                                 They may also participate in bug bounty programs, where companies offer rewards to hackers who identify and report vulnerabilities in their systems.
                                 White hat hackers may also develop and promote security best practices, and may work with law enforcement or other organizations to help combat cybercrime.
                             __Black hat hacker definition__
                                 __Black hat hackers are criminals who break into computer networks with malicious intent. They may also release malware that destroys files, holds computers hostage, or steals passwords, credit card numbers, and other personal information.__
                                 __Black hats are motivated by self-serving reasons, such as financial gain, revenge, or simply to spread havoc. Sometimes their motivation might be ideological, by targeting people they strongly disagree with.__
                             __White hat hacker definition__
                                 __White hat hackers – sometimes also called “ethical hackers” or “good hackers” – are the antithesis of black hats. They exploit computer systems or networks to identify their security flaws so they can make recommendations for improvement__
                             __Gray hat hacker definition__
                                 __Somewhere between white and black are gray hat hackers. Gray hat hackers enact a blend of both black hat and white hat activities. Gray hat hackers often look for vulnerabilities in a system without the owner's permission or knowledge. If issues are found, they report them to the owner, sometimes requesting a small fee to fix the problem.__
                                 __A grey hat is a computer hacker or computer security expert who may sometimes violate laws or typical ethical standards, but usually does not have the malicious intent typical of a black hat hacker.__
                                 __Some gray hat hackers like to believe they are doing something good for companies by hacking their websites and invading their networks without permission. Still, company owners rarely appreciate unauthorized forays into their business information infrastructure.__
                                 __Often, a gray hat's real intention is to show off their skills and gain publicity — maybe even appreciation — for what they consider a contribution to cybersecurity.__

                                 Denote $${\mathcal{G}}(A,B,C)$$ bimatrix game with rational payoff functions
                                 The corresponding payoffs to Player 1 and Player 2 are $$\frac{^\top{\!}xAy}{^\mathsf{T}{\!}xCy}$$ and $$\frac{^\top{\!}xBy}{^\top{\!}xCy}$$ respectively. 
                                 An __equilibrium strategy__ $$(x^*,y^*)$$ satisfies $$x^*Cy^*\neq 0$$ and
                                     $$ \frac{x^*Ay^*}{x^*Cy^*} \ge  \frac{xAy^*}{xCy^*} \quad\forall x: xCy^*\neq 0$$

                                 We say that $$s^*=(x^*,y^*)$$ is an __NE strategy profile__ and that $$v=(v_A,v_B)$$ is the corresponding __NE equilibrium value pair__.

                             Generalised Eigensystem Theorem #slide 
                                 The following theorem gives a sufficient condition for the existence of an NE of the form (\ref{eq:NE-bimatrix). 
                                 Given the game $$\mathcal{G}(A,B,C)$$, assume the matrix pencils $$A-\lambda C$$  and $$B-\lambda C$$ are both regular, each with a real eigenvalue $$\mu_A$$ and $$\mu_B$$ respectively. Let $$x_{\mu_B}$$ be a nonnegative left eigenvector of $$B-\lambda C$$ with respect to $$\mu_B$$ and denote $$y_{\mu_A}$$ a nonnegative right eigenvector of $$B-\lambda C$$ with respect to $$\mu_A$$. Then $$(x^*,y^*) = (x_{\mu_B}$$, $$y_{\mu_A}$$) is an NE strategy profile of the game $$\mathcal{G}$$ and $$(\mu_A, \mu_B)$$ is the corresponding game value pair.
                             Proof #slide 
                                 We have for a nonnegative left eigenvector $$x_{\mu_B}$$ satisfying $$x^\top_{\mu_B} B = \mu_B x^\top_{\mu_B} C$$ that for any Player 2 strategy $$y$$ it holds $$\frac{x^\top_{\mu_B} B y}{x^\top_{\mu_B} C y} = \mu_B $$. 
                                 This trivially implies $$\frac{x^\top_{\mu_B} B y_{\mu_A}}{x^\top_{\mu_B} C y_{\mu_A}} \ge \frac{x^\top_{\mu_B} B y}{x^\top_{\mu_B} C y} $$. 
                                 Similarly, we can show for a nonnegative right eigenvector $$y_{\mu_A}$$ that $$\frac{x^\top_{\mu_B} Ay_{\mu_A}}{x^\top_{\mu_B} C y_{\mu_A}} \ge \frac{x Ay_{\mu_A}}{x C y_{\mu_A}} $$ for any Player 1 strategy $$x$$.
                                 Hence these strategies are mutual best responses and by definition NE strategies with payoffs $$\mu_A$$ and $$\mu_B$$ as required.  
                                 From this, the theorem follows. 
                             Remarks #slide 
                                 If $$C=E$$, this yields a linear algebra characterisation for NE solutions for standard bimatrix games.
                                 If eigenvectors are positive, we obtain completely mixed solutions
                                 Compare with Milchtaich \cite{Milchtaich2006-ro,Milchtaich2008-ny}, w/o LA

                                 If $$B=-A$$, one obtains the work by Thomson et al.~\cite{} on the von Neumann model for game theory.
                                 A mixed solution is a generalised eigensystem.

                                 We call this a __rank-1 pencil__. 
                                 We can write $$B=uv^\top$$ where $$u,v\in {\R}^n$$ nonnegative. 
                                 We define normalised left and right eigenvectors w.r.t. the factorisation of $$B$$ as eigenvectors satisfying $$x^\top u = 1$$ and $$y v^\top = 1$$. 
                             Eigenspace Structure rank-1 regular pencil Result #slide 
                                 If $$v^\top \text{adj}(A) u=0$$, the pencil has no finite eigenvalues. 
                                 Otherwise, the pencil has a single finite eigenvalue $$c=\frac{\det(A)}{v^\top \text{adj}(A) u}$$.
                                 The associated left and right normalised eigenvectors $$x,y$$ can be determined as follows:
                                     $$x^\top=\frac{v^\top\text{adj}(A)}{v^\top \text{adj}(A) u}$$,
                                     $$y=\frac{\text{adj}(A)u}{v^\top \text{adj}(A) u}$$.
                             Proof #slide #proof
                                 It can directly be verified that, based on the definitions of $$c$$, $$x$$ and $$y$$ as in the theorem, that it holds $$Ay=cuv^\top y$$ and $$x^\top A=cx^\top uv^\top$$. 
                                 So $$c$$ is an eigenvalue, and this must be the only one as the degree of the characteristic polynomial $$\det(A-\lambda B)$$ is one. 
                                 Furthermore, it can be seen that $$x^\top$$ and $$y$$ are normalised eigenvectors.

                                 \subsection{Rank-1 Bimatrix Games}
                                 This section considers the case where $$C\ge 0$$, $${\rm rank}(C)=1$$, and the implications on the existence of NE solutions of the game $${\mathcal{G}}(A,B,C)$$.
                                 
                                 We refer to a matrix pencil of the form $$A-\lambda B$$ and $${\rm rank}(C)=1$$ as a rank-1 pencil. We can then use rank-factorisation to write $$C={p}{q}$$ where $${p},{q}\in \mathbb{R}^n$$ are nonnegative row and column vectors.
                                 We define normalised left and right eigenvectors w.r.t. the representation $$C=pq$$ as eigenvectors satisfying $$x {p} = 1$$ and $$y {q} = 1$$.
                                 
                                 The following proposition provides an eigenspace structure result for rank-1 regular matrix pencils, which will be required when analysing the Shades of Grey game in Section \ref{sec:shades-of-grey}.
                                 \begin{proposition}
                                     The rank-1 pencil $$A-\lambda pq$$ has no finite eigenvalues if $${q}\,{\rm adj}(A) {p}=0$$. Otherwise, the pencil has the single finite eigenvalue $$c=\frac{\det(A)}{{q} \,\,{\rm adj}(A) {p}}$$.
                                     The associated left and right normalised eigenvectors $$x,y$$ can be determined explicitly using the formulae $$x=\frac{{q}\,{\rm adj}(A)}{{q} \,{\rm adj}(A) {p}}$$ and $$y=\frac{\,{\rm adj}(A){p}}{{q} \,{\rm adj}(A) {p}}$$.
                                 \end{proposition}
                                 \begin{proof}
                                     Based on the definitions of $$c$$, $$x$$ and $$y$$ as in the proposition, it can be directly verified that $$Ay=c{p}{q} y$$ and $$x A=cx {p}{q}$$.
                                     So $$c$$ is a finite eigenvalue of $$A-\lambda pq$$ with left and right eigenvectors $$x$$ and $$y$$. This must be the only eigenvalue as the degree of the characteristic polynomial $$\det(A-\lambda pq)$$ is bound by $${\rm rank}(pq)$$, which is one. Furthermore, it is straightforward to see that $$x$$ and $$y$$ are normalised eigenvectors.
                                 \end{proof}

                                 In this game model, we have $$N=1$$ using the notations of \cite{Shapley1953-hi}. 
                                 Using modern terminology, we would say we have a 2-state Markov-game with a transient state $$s_0$$ ``play" and an absorbing state $$s_1$$ ``stop''. 
                                 State transition probabilities depend on the current state and chosen strategies.

                                     What is the expected number of steps for the game to finish?
                                     How can we define a value and optimal solutions to this repeated zero-sum game?
                                     How it might these relate to the value and optimal solutions of the stage game?
                                 Let us fix a strategy profile $$(x^\top,y)$$.

                                 The following well-known lemma summarises answers:
                                 \begin{lemma}[\cite{Shapley1953-hi}]
                                     The expected number of steps required for the game $$\mathcal{G}(A,S)$$ to stop when using the stationary strategy $$(x^\top,y)$$ is $$1/x^\top Sy$$. The expected resulting payoff  is $$u=\frac{x^\top Ay}{x^\top Sy}.$$ The value $$v$$ of the game is well-defined by
                                     $$ v=\max_x\min_y \frac{x^\top Ay}{x^\top Sy} = \min_y\max_x \frac{x^\top Ay}{x^\top Sy}. $$
                                     In general, $$v$$ is hence different from the value of the stage game.
                                 \end{lemma}

                                     Assume the stationary strategy $$(x^\top,y)$$ satisfies $$x^\top Sy<1$$.
                                     Then the expected number of steps required for the game $$\mathcal{G}(A,B,S)$$ to stop when the players are using $$(x^\top,y)$$ is $$1/x^\top Sy$$. The expected resulting payoff is $$u=(\frac{x^\top Ay}{x^\top Sy},\frac{x^\top By}{x^\top Sy}).$$ 
                                 \end{lemma}
                             Proof #slide 
                                 After $$k$$ iterations the accumulated payoff of the game when playing the same strategy $$(x^\top,y)$$ in each round is $$u_{A,k}(x,y)=x^\top Ay\sum_{i=0}^{k-1}(1-x^\top Sy)^i$$ and $$u_{B,k}(x,y)=x^\top By\sum_{i=0}^{k-1}(1-x^\top Sy)^i$$. 
                                 Since $$s:=1-x^\top Sy<1$$, the game finishes with probability one and $$ \sum_{i=0}^\infty s^i = \frac{1}{1-s}$$.
                                 The expected game payoff pair is $$u = (u_{A},u_{B}) = \lim_{k\to \infty}(u_{A,k},u_{B,k})=(\frac{x^\top Ay}{x^\top Sy},\frac{x^\top By}{x^\top Sy})$$.

                                 This value might not be specific to $$u$$, and not unique

                                         Similarly a best response to $$x$$ is a strategy $$y\in \mathcal{BR}(x)$$ of Player 2 that maximizing her expected payoff $$x^\top By/x^\top Cy$$.

                                         An equilibrium strategy is hence a strategy pair $$(x^*,y^*)$$ of mutual best responses: $$ x^* \in \mathcal{BR}(y^*) $$ and $$ y^* \in \mathcal{BR}(x^*) $$.

                                             If Player 1's mixed strategy $$x^*$$ is a best response to the (mixed) strategy $$y$$ of the other player, then, for each pure strategy $$e_i$$ such that $$x_i > 0$$, it must be the case that $$e_i$$ is itself a best response.  In particular, the payoff $$e_i Ay$$ must be the same for all such strategies.
                                         Note: an analogous lemma can be stated for Player 2, $$y^*$$ and $$x$$.
                                     Proof (I) #slide #CYENS 
                                         Recap: due to $$x^* \in \mathcal{BR}(y^*)$$ we have $${}^t \!x^*Ay^*=v_{A}$$ and $${}^t \!xAy^*\le v_{A}$$ for all $$x$$. 
                                         Let us write $${}^t \!x^*= (x^*_{1},\ldots ,x^*_{i},\ldots ,x^*_{n})$$ and assume $$x^*_{i}\neq 0$$.
                                         Furthermore, denote $${}^t \!e_{i}= (\underbrace{0,\ldots ,0}_{i-1}, 1, 0,\ldots , 0)$$.
                                         It is clear that $${}^t \!e_{i}Ay^*\le v_{A}$$ (why?).
                                     Proof (II) #slide #CYENS 
                                         Now assume $${}^t \!e_{i}Ay^*< v_{A}$$, minimal for all pure strategies. 
                                         Find $$j\neq i$$, $$x_{j}^*\neq 0$$ (such $$j$$ exists since $$x^*$$ is not pure) and define ("falling from the sky"):
                                             $${}^t \!\hat{x}={}^t \!x^*-x_i^* {\;}^t\! e_i+x_i^* {\;}^t\! e_j$$.
                                         It follows
                                             $$^t\!\hat{x}Ay^*={}^t\!x^*Ay^*+x_{i}^*\overbrace{(^t\!e_{j}Ay^*-{}^t\!e_{i}Ay^*)}^{>0}>\,{}^t\! x^*Ay^*$$
                                         which is a contradiction. Hence we must have $${}^t \!e_{i}Ay^*= v_{A}$$. 
                                         An additional consequence is $${}^t \!x^*Ay^*= v_{A}{}^t\!e$$.

                                                 If $$b_a \le b_f$$, then the equilibrium is pure with $${}^tx^*=(0,1),y^*=\begin{pmatrix}  0\\1  \\ \end{pmatrix}$$ and $$v^*_D=b_p-c_f,v^*_G=b_f$$.
                                                 If $$b_a > b_f$$, then there is an equilibrium with one mixed and one pure strategy: $${}^tx^*=\begin{pmatrix}  \frac{b_a-b_f}{2b_a-c_r},&\frac{b_a+b_f-c_r}{2b_a-c_r}  \\ \end{pmatrix},y^*=\begin{pmatrix}  0\\1  \\ \end{pmatrix}$$ and $$v^*_D=b_p-c_f,v^*_G=b_a$$.

                     One of the early works which was a source of inspiration for this present paper is @KAPLANSKI. In his article, the value $$v$$ of a zero-sum game is determined from its coefficient matrix, although the algorithm is not efficient. The uniqueness property of completely mixed solutions is established and their presence detected based on necessary and sufficient conditions involving order, rank and adjoint properties of the game matrix $$A$$, after reducing $$v$$ to zero using a substitution.
                     Theorem #theorem:bimatrix-mixed:ref of this paper, when specialised to matrix games, generalises Kaplanski's result as the  necessary and sufficient conditions stated in the theorem are valid for any value $$v$$.

                 @THOMPSON #wfe-ignore-item 
                     In a series of papers ( @THOMPSON-a, @THOMPSON-b) work on the relationship between matrix games and generalised eigensystems, later extended to a more general problem (the Von Neumann economic model) in @THOMPSON-c, was undertaken. 
                     These results failed to achieve great  attention in the wider game theory research community apart from the niche specialist area due to their "lack of parsimony" (as quoted from @THOMPSON-a) and inability of leading to significant algorithmic improvements. 
                     One of the game theoretical insights gained in this paper is the fact that for restricted types of equilibrium solutions --- that of completely mixed ones --- the view of equilibrium solutions as solutions of associated generalised eigensystems is in fact very natural and useful, as will be demonstrated in the application section of this paper.

                     More recently, @RAGHAVAN revisits @KAPLANSKI and initiates an extension to bimatrix games. 
                     In his work, Raghavan shows that important properties of completely mixed solutions known for matrix games also are valid for bimatrix games. His main result is that completely mixed equilibrium strategies are unique and require the game matrices to be square. 
                     However Theorem xxx is not stated for bimatrix games. A necessary condition is given, on the other hand, the result is not constructive, as supportive of Theorem 4 in \cite{} requires the knowledge of the game's value pair.
                     His work does not use the notion of generalised eigensystems. 
                 @MILCHTAICH #wfe-ignore-item 
                     In two consecutive papers ( @MILCHTAICH2006, @MILCHTAICH200x ), the authors present work which is closely related to the results of this section, although they do not use the language of generalised eigensystems. In the first paper, a formula is developed for determining an equilibrium value of a bimatrix game if the support of the corresponding solution is known in advance. This is extended in the second paper where necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of completely mixed solutions are given, and an explicit solution formula is constructed for this case. 
                     Using the linear algebra concepts of this paper, their results can be viewed as stating necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of non-negative (strictly positive in the completely mixed case) left and right generalised eigenvectors of the game matrices, with respect to real generalised eigenvalues, as well as the explicit construction of these. Their solution formula, necessary and sufficient conditions for completely mixed solutions are algebraically equivalent to the ones developed in this paper.

                             In this paper, $$x$$ and $$y$$ denote a pure or mixed strategy of the first and second player in a two-player game, and $$x^*$$ and $$y^*$$ are used for optimal strategies of these players. A __strategy profile__ $$s=(x, y)$$ groups strategies of each player together. If the grouped strategies are optimal, the optimal strategy profile is written as $$s^*$$. A two-player non-zero sum game can be represented in normal form, based on the players' payoff matrices $$A$$ and $$B$$, and it is common in the literature and also in this paper to use a table to present the same information.
                             An __optimal Nash Equilibrium strategy profile __ is a strategy profile $$s^*=(x^*,y^*)$$ satisfying  
                                 $$ x^*Ay^* \ge  xAy^* \;\;\forall x,\quad x^*By^* \ge    x^*By\;\;\forall y$$. #wfe-style:Equation
                             Here, the strategies may be pure or mixed, and the corresponding NE is referred to as pure or mixed NE. Furthermore, if all of the inequalities in the above definition are strict, one has a __strict__ NE. Otherwise, the NE is __non-strict__.

                             Concept #h3
                                 The principal idea of non-cooperative game theory is to consider rational players, choosing between actions that entail payoffs consisting of gains (benefits) and losses (costs), in order to form __optimal strategies__ seeking to maximise their payoffs
                                 A game is solved using the fundamental concept of the Nash Equilibrium, as described in Section \ref{sec:scheduling_game}.
                                 An optimal Nash Equilibrium (NE) strategy has a local maximum property: any single player deviating from a NE strategy will suffer a reduced payoff
                                 It is important to note that only unilateral strategy changes are considered in this concept
                                 Hence applying game theory for real-life scenarios is only a valid and useful tool if all participants agree to adopt it as a rule for strategic decision-making, in the modelled scenario
                                 #wfe-ignore-item 
                                 __Zero-sum__ games are used for simple scenarios where it can be assumed that the gains or losses of one player are balanced out by those for the remaining ones
                                 . For more complex scenarios, __nonzero-sum__ games may be requir
                                 ed. A nonzero-sum game may not have any clear winner or looser, and its NE strategies may not necessarily be unique, implying that different optimal strategies with different payoffs e
                                 xist. An NE strategy whose payoff is largest amongst all other optimal solutions, is referred to as __globally optimal solution__.
                             Mixed strategies extend pure strategies by introducing probability distributionsAn arbitrary game need not always have to have optimal solutions following the above definition, and this can be resolved using the more general idea of mixed strategies
                             Nash's theorem then states that any $$n$$-player non-cooperative game not possessing a pure NE admits a mixed NE
                             Mixed strategies are very relevant in the context of security games, as most of these games do not have pure NEs
                             On the other hand, the practical interpretation of mixed NES remains controversial  \cite{} \Eckhard{Fariborz, could ypu please add this reference: Aumann, R (1985) What Is Game Theory Trying to Accomplish In: Arrow, K and Honkapohja, S., Eds., Frontiers of Economics, Basil Blackwell, Oxford, 5-46.} and for this reason, for the game introduced in this paper, the focus is on pure NEs.

                                     She can also decide to deceive the recipient, by sending a correct report
                                     Generally, she will try to optimise the rewards from the attack or deception versus potential punishment such as loss of reputation or prosecution
                                     This can be modelled as an IDS game where the defence action of the report receiver is to not trust the report

                     The Human-in-the-Loop Principle #slide 
                         Definition: Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) is a design pattern that integrates human expertise into the automated process of a system.
                         Explanation: This means that humans are involved in the loop of a system to make critical decisions, improve the system's performance, and ensure accountability.
                         Benefits: HITL systems are more flexible, adaptable, and can handle edge cases better than purely automated systems. They can improve the accuracy and efficiency of the system, while also providing a means of accountability for actions taken.
                         Example: HITL is often used in cybersecurity, where automated systems are combined with human expertise to detect and respond to security threats. For example, security analysts can be alerted to potential attacks and then investigate to determine the validity of the threat and decide on the appropriate response.
                         Challenges: Implementing HITL systems can be challenging because it requires the integration of human expertise with automated processes. It also requires proper training, clear communication, and well-defined roles and responsibilities to ensure that the human-in-the-loop system functions effectively.

                         Tremendous amounts of oil and gas products are transported in pipelines worldwide resulting in increasing interest to identify the hazards and evaluate the associated risks associated with this critical infrastructure. Third-party intrusion is one of the least quantifiable factors being considered during the pipeline hazard assessment stage despite the substantial contributing to the total number of oil and gas pipeline incidents. This is because a probabilistic risk assessment cannot reliably model human actions and be applied to intentional acts. Due to the distinctive motivations of third-party damage, an unintentional third-party damage Bayesian Network model and a game-theoretic model on malicious intrusion will therefore be built, to examine the mechanism of pipeline failure caused by this mode. This study is conducted aiming at investigating pipeline risk resulting from third-party damage, and will formulate risk assessment models to identify threats, prioritize risks and determine which integrity plan should apply to different pipeline segments given the condition of third-party interference (both the accidental damage and malicious acts).

                         Introduction #slide 
                             SA game is a __proactive__ security game (actions are non-observable, this is a static game)
                             Single-target game: we only consider one target. The focus is on the single asset that has a vulnerability.
                             Most simple attacker defender scenario.
                                 Rows corresponds to the strategies available to the defender.
                                 Columns are the attacker's strategies.
                             Strategies:
                                 $$S_\mathcal{D} = \{$$defend, not defend$$\} = \{s_d, s_{-d}\}$$ 
                                 $$S_\mathcal{A} = \{$$ attack, not attack $$\} = \{s_a, s_{-a}\}$$

                             $$c_{\mathcal{D}}$$ -- the defense cost
                             $$I$$ -- the defender's cost due to the impact of an attack
                             $$c_{\mathcal{A}}$$ -- the attacker's cost
                             $$G$$ -- the gain (benefit) of the attacker from an attack.
                             Assumptions:
                                 __Principle of Adequate Protection__: $$c_{\mathcal{D}} <I$$
                                 __Principle of Easiest Attack__: $$c_{\mathcal{A}} < G$$

                             We will also use bimatrix notation $$\mathcal{G}(A,B)$$.
                         Game Equilibrium Analysis #slide 
                             There is a unique mixed NE solution pair with
                                 $$x^{*} = \frac{G-c_{\mathcal{A}}}{G} = 1 - \frac{c_{\mathcal{A}}}{G}$$
                                 $$y^{*} = \frac{c_{\mathcal{D}}}{I}$$
                             The corresponding optimal expected payoffs are:
                                  $$s^{*}_d = -c_{\mathcal{D}} $$
                                 $$s^{*}_a =  0 $$ 
                             The game is strategically zero-sum. 
                         Game Analysis Summary #slide
                             In order to slightly simplify the game, we assume "the winner gets it all": $$G = I$$
                             **Theorem 1**. The security game $$\mathcal{G}(\mathcal{D},\mathcal{A})$$ has no pure Nash Equilibrium. A mixed Nash Equilibrium strategy pair $$(x_\mathcal{D}^∗,y_\mathcal{A}^∗)$$ is obtained, where $$x_\mathcal{D}^∗=1-c_\mathcal{A}/G$$ and $$y_\mathcal{A}^∗=c_\mathcal{D}/I$$ are the probability of defense and attack respectively. The resulting expected payoffs, in this case, are $$u_\mathcal{D}^∗=−c_\mathcal{D}$$ and $$u_\mathcal{A}^∗=0$$.
                             **Proof**: The proof of this theorem will be obtained as a special case for that of Theorem 2.
                         Discussion #slide 
                             Main problem: $$u_\mathcal{A}^∗=0$$.
                                 Would this be desirable for attacker?
                                 GT needs to be accepted by all real-world players.
                             Solution: reward scheme.
                                 If outcomes of security assessment match observed reality, there will be a reward $$r_{\mathcal{D}}$$ for the defender
                                 Otherwise, the attacker will benefit from a reward $$r_{\mathcal{A}}$$.

                             **Theorem 2**. The security game $$\mathcal{G}_r(A, B, \mathcal{D},\mathcal{A})$$ has no pure Nash Equilibrium. A mixed Nash Equilibrium strategy pair $$(x_\mathcal{D}^∗,y_\mathcal{A}^∗)$$ is obtained, where $$x_\mathcal{D}^∗=1 - \frac{r_{\mathcal{A}}+c_{\mathcal{A}}}{G+2r_{\mathcal{A}}}$$ and $$y_\mathcal{A}^∗=\frac{c_{\mathcal{D}}+r_{\mathcal{D}}}{2r_{\mathcal{D}}+I}$$ are the probability of defense and attack respectively. The resulting expected payoffs, in this case, are $$u_\mathcal{D}^∗=\frac{r_{\mathcal{D}}^2−c_\mathcal{D}(I+r_{\mathcal{D}})}{I+2r_{\mathcal{D}}}$$ and $$u_\mathcal{A}^∗=\frac{r_{\mathcal{A}}^2+r_\mathcal{A}(G-c_{\mathcal{A}})}{G+2r_{\mathcal{A}}}$$. Furthermore, if $$r_{\mathcal{A}}>0$$ then it holds $$u_\mathcal{A}^∗>0$$.

                             For a generic matrix $$A$$, the components of a generalised eigensystem $$\mathcal{E}_A=\left(\mu, x^t, y\right)$$ are determined as follows:
                                 The eigenvalue is the real number $$\mu = {{a_{1}\,a_{4}-a_{2}\,a_{3}}\over{a_{1}+a_{4}-a_{2}-a_{3}}}$$, assuming that the denominator in this expression does not vanish. 
                                 The corresponding left eigenvector  is $$x^t=\left(a_{3}-a_{1}\right)\,\begin{pmatrix}a_{4}-a_{3}&a_{1}-a_{2}\end{pmatrix}$$ and $$y=\left(a_{1}-a_{2}\right)\begin{pmatrix}a_{2}-a_{4}\cr a_{3}-a_{1}\end{pmatrix}$$ is the right eigenvector.

                             We have
                                 $$\mu_A = {{a_{1}\,a_{4}-a_{2}\,a_{3}}\over{a_{1}+a_{4}-a_{2}-a_{3}}}$$

                         Fundamental Theorem #slide 
                             Specialising the work of (Thompson et al) to matrix games, we extend their main fundamental theorem to bimatrix games as follows: 
                             Given a square bimatrix game $$G(A,B)$$, assume the matrix pencils $$A-\lambda E$$  and $$B-\lambda E$$ are both regular, each with a real eigenvalue $$\mu_A$$ and $$\mu_B$$ respectively. Let $$x_{\mu_B}$$ be a nonnegative left eigenvector of $$B-\lambda E$$ with respect to $$\mu_B$$ and denote $$y_{\mu_A}$$ a nonnegative right eigenvector of $$A-\lambda E$$ with respect to $$\mu_A$$.

                             The proof of the theorem will be aided by the following lemma. 
                             It exhibits a special case arising where there exists a strategy of one player to which any strategy of the other player is a best response.
                             Following the notations as in the theorem, we have for a nonnegative left generalised eigenvector $$x_{\mu_B}$$ that for all Player 2 strategies $$y$$ it holds $$x^\top_{\mu_B} B y = \mu_B $$. Similarly, a nonnegative right eigenvector $$y_{\mu_A}$$ satisfies $$x^\top A y_{\mu_A} = \mu_A$$ for all Player 1 strategies $$x$$. #eyo-style:Lemma  #lemma:best-response-eigen
                         Proof [of lemma] #slide #wfe-ignore-outline 
                             #eyo-style:Proof 
                                 Assume that $$x^{\top}_{\mu_A}\ge 0$$ is a left eigenvector, associated with the eigenvalue $${\mu_A}$$ of the regular matrix pencil $$A-\lambda E$$. This implies
                                 #equation:left-nullspace-eq
                                      $$ x^{\top}_{\mu_A}(A-{\mu_A} E)=0. $$
                                 Due to the normalisation property $$\sum x_{{\mu_A},i}=1$$ we have $$ x^{\top}_{\mu_A} E = x^{\top}_{\mu_A} ee^{\top}=e^{\top}$$ so that equation #ref:left-nullspace-eq implies 
                                     $$ x^{\top}_{\mu_A} A = {\mu_A} e^{\top}$$.  #displaymaths 
                                 The second property for a right eigenvector $$y_{\mu_B}$$ can be shown similarly. From this, the lemma follows. 
                         Proof [of Theorem #ref:bimatrix-regular-theorem ] #slide #wfe-ignore-outline 
                             Let $$y_{\mu_A}$$ be nonnegative right eigenvector of $$A-\lambda E$$ with respect to the eigenvalue $$\mu_A$$. From Lemma #ref:best-response-lemma we deduce that $$y_{\mu_A}$$ is a best response to any Player 1 strategy $$x$$, in particular to  $$x=x_{\mu_B}$$. Likewise,  denote $$x_{\mu_B}$$ a nonnegative left generalised eigenvector of $$B-\lambda E$$. We obtain that  $$x_{\mu_B}$$ is a best response to Player 2 strategy $$y=y_{\mu_A}$$. Hence these strategies are mutual best responses and by definition mixed Nash Equilibrium strategies with payoffs $$\mu_A$$ and $$\mu_B$$ as required. #proof 
                         Case 1 #slide 
                             The non-existence of a pure NE leads to the following conditions, up to permution: $$a_1>a_3$$, $$a_4>a_2$$, $$b_2>b_1$$ and $$b_3>b_4$$.
                             We deduce that both eigenvalues $$\mu_A$$ and $$\mu_B$$ are well defined. 
                             The vectors $$x_B^t$$ and $$y_A$$ are non-zero. 
                             Furthermore each vector has entries having the same sign. 
                                 Define $$\text{sign}(v)$$ as the sign of #wfe-ignore-item 
                             Apply Theorem #theorem:bimatrix-regular-theorem to obtain the unique mixed NE solution pair. 
                         Case 2 #slide 
                             With two pure NEs one obtains $$a_1>a_3$$, $$a_4>a_2$$, $$b_1>b_2$$ and $$b_4>b_3$$.
                             As in Case 1, both vectors are non-zero and all entries have the same sign. 
                             Same approach to obtain the unique mixed NE solution pair by applying Theorem #theorem:bimatrix-regular-theorem . 
                         Case 3 #slide 
                             In this case, a single pure NE implies either 
                             Case (i): $$a_1>a_3$$, $$a_4>a_2$$, $$b_1>b_2$$ and $$b_3>b_4$$; or
                             Case (ii): $$a_1>a_3$$, $$a_2>a_4$$, $$b_1>b_2$$ and $$b_3>b_4$$.
                             There is dominance
                                 In both case (i) and (ii): column 2 of $$B$$ is dominated by column 1
                                 In the case of (ii): row 2 of $$A$$ is also dominated by row 1
                             The game is trivial for at least one of the players.
                             Algebraic property: empty generalised eigensystem.
                             This implies $$\det(A-\lambda E)\equiv c\neq 0$$ or the existence of not nonnegative eigenvectors.

                                 $$\mathcal U$$ aims to implement an afforable and simple steganographic technique with hope that the secret message will be transmitted securly

                                     Theorem 1. The security game has no pure Nash Equilibrium strategy.
                                     Proof: By inspecting the game.

A mixed Nash Equilibrium strategy $$(s_{\mathcal U}^*,s^*_{\mathcal S})$$ is obtained, where $$p^*=\dfrac{b_{leak}-c_{look}}{b_{leak}}$$ and $$q^*=\dfrac{c_{hide}}{c_{leak}}$$ are the probability of hiding and looking respectively. The resulting expected utilities in this case are $$u_{\mathcal U}^*=-c_{hide}$$ and $$u_{\mathcal S}^*=0$$.
                                     Proof: Following Nash.

                                     There is an associated generalised nonnegative left eigenvector $$x_\mu ^t\Longrightarrow \underline{v} \ge \mu$$.

                                     Define the matrix
                                         $$M=\begin{pmatrix}  I_r&R^\top \\ \alpha L & \beta A  \\  \end{pmatrix}$$.
                                     Applying the block-determinant identity to the submatrix $$I_r$$, we obtain
                                         $$\det(M)=\det(\beta A- \alpha B)$$.
                                     On the other hand, we can swap rows and columns block-wise while preserving the determinant of the block-matrix, and apply the same identity to the top left block of
                                         $$\tilde{M}=\begin{pmatrix}  \beta A & \alpha L  \\ R^\top & I_r\\   \end{pmatrix}$$.
                                     Collecting powers of $$\beta$$, this yields
                                         $$\det(\tilde{M})=\beta^{n-r}\det(A)\det(\beta I_r-\alpha R^\top A^{-1}L)$$.
                                     This proves the lemma.

                         The eigensystem can then be derived from that of $$C$$:
                             The finite, nonzero eigenvalues of $$C$$ can be mapped into the finite eigenvalues of $$A-\lambda B$$,
                             The matrix eigenvalue zero corresponds to the infinite eigenvalue of the pencil.

                         If $$B=LR^\top$$ is a full-rank factorisation and $$k\in \R$$ such that $$A+kB$$ is nonsingular, there is a one-to-one correspondence between eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $$A-\lambda B$$ and those of $$C=R^\top (A+kB)^{-1}L$$. For each right eigenvector $$y_\mu$$ of $$C$$ associated with an eigenvalue $$\mu$$ (left eigenvector $$x^\top_\mu$$ respectively), if $$A^{-1}Ly_\mu\neq 0$$, this vector is a right eigenvector (the vector $$x^\top_\mu R^\top A^{-1}\neq 0$$ is a left eigenvector respectively) of $$P(\lambda)$$ with finite eigenvalue $$\lambda=\mu^{-1}-k$$ if $$\mu\neq 0$$, and the infinite eigenvalue otherwise. #theorem
                     On Rank-1 Regular Matrix Pencils #h
                         Introduction #slide 
                             Consider a regular matrix pencil of the form $$A-\lambda B$$ where $$\text{rank}(B)=1$$. 
                             We call this a __rank-1 pencil__. 
                             We can write $$B=uv^\top$$ where $$u,v\in {\R_{\neq 0}}^n$$. 
                             Note that then $$\text{rank}(A) \ge n-1$$ (as otherwise $$\text{rank}(A-\mu B) < n-1+1 =n$$ for all $$\mu \in \R$$ and the pencil would not be regular).
                         Remarks #slide 
                             It is clear that the pencil has an eigenvalue at infinity with algebraic multiplicity $$m_\infty=n-1$$. 
                             The corresponding left and right eigenvectors are the elements of $$\text{ker}(B^\top)$$ and $$\text{ker}(B)$$.
                             Now the goal is to find the structure of the finite eigenspaces.
                         Eigenspace Structure Result #slide 
                             We define normalised left and right eigenvectors w.r.t. the factorisation of $$B$$ as eigenvectors satisfying $$x^\top u = 1$$ and $$y v^\top = 1$$. 
                             Structure theorem for finite eigenspace of rank-1 regular pencil:  #novel:theorem
                                 If $$v^\top \text{adj}(A) u=0$$, the pencil has no finite eigenvalues. 
                                 Otherwise, the pencil has a single finite eigenvalue $$c=\frac{\det(A)}{v^\top \text{adj}(A) u}$$.
                                 The associated left and right normalised eigenvectors $$x,y$$ can be determined as follows:
                                     $$x^\top=\frac{v^\top\text{adj}(A)}{v^\top \text{adj}(A) u}$$,
                                     $$y=\frac{\text{adj}(A)u}{v^\top \text{adj}(A) u}$$.
                         Proof of Theorem #slide #proof
                             It can directly be verified that, based on the definitions of $$c$$, $$x$$ and $$y$$ as in the theorem, that it holds $$Ay=cuv^\top y$$ and $$x^\top A=cx^\top uv^\top$$. 
                             So $$c$$ is an eigenvalue, and this must be the only one as the degree of the characteristic polynomial is one. 
                             Furthermore, it can be seen that $$x^\top$$ and $$y$$ are normalised eigenvectors.
                         Some Matrix-Adjoint Identities #slide #novel:proposition 
                             The previous results allow proving the following identities:
                             #proposition For $$a\in \R$$, the following holds:
                                 $$\det(A+a uv^\top)=\det(A)+ av^\top\text{adj}(A)u$$
                                 $$v^\top \;\text{adj}(A+a uv^\top)=v^\top\;\text{adj}(A)$$
                                 $$\text{adj}(A+a uv^\top)u=\text{adj}(A)u$$
                         Proof of Identities #slide 
                             Note that if $$v^\top\;\text{adj}(A)u= 0$$, it follows $$\det(A+a uv^\top)=\det(A)$$ and hence the identities are trivially fulfilled in this case.
                             Otherwise:
                                 It must hold $$\det(A+\lambda uv^\top)=b\lambda +\det(A)$$. 
                                 This is the characteristic polynomial. 
                                 Then we can solve for $$\lambda = -\frac{\det(A)}{b}$$. 
                                 Since $$-\lambda$$ is an eigenvalue, the previous theorem yields $$b=v^\top \text{adj}(A) u$$.
                             The other identities are immediate consequences of the fact that $$A-\lambda uv^\top$$ and $$(A+a uv^\top)-\lambda uv^\top$$ have the same eigenvectors for all real numbers $$a$$.
                         Remarks #slide 
                             The first identity is also known as __matrix determinant lemma__ in the literature \cite{}. 
                             The three identities generalise Karlin's well-known identities for computing optimal solutions of matrix games.

                         #proposition If the pencil is irreducible, the formulae as in Proposition \ref{} still apply.  
                         Proof
                             Being irreducible, the pencil is similar to either $$I-\lambda N$$ or $$J-\lambda I$$ where $$N$$ is a single nilpotent Jordan block and $$J$$ a single Jordan block with eigenvalue $$\mu\in\R$$. 
                             The case that needs examining is if $$A$$ singular, which corresponds to the latter with $$\mu=0$$. 
                             But then $$\text{rank}(A)=n-1$$, and there exist $$\tilde{u},\tilde{v}\in\R^n$$ such that $$\text{adj}(A)=\tilde{u}\tilde{v}^\top$$. 
                             Then $$x^\top=\tilde{v}^\top L$$, $$y=R\tilde{u}$$.

                             The substitution $$\lambda \leftarrow \lambda+a$$ where $$a\in \R$$ adds $$a$$ to all finite eigenvalues and leaves their eigenvectors invariant. Without loss of generality, it can thus be assumed that $$\det(A)=f(0)=a\neq 0$$ and that $$A$$ be invertible.

                         GENERAL PROPERTIES OF EVENTUALLY NONNEGATIVE MATRICES
                             Zaslavsky, McDonald, and Tam [31], [32] studied the Jordan form of eventuallynonnegative matrices. 
                             Carnochan Naqvi and McDonald [5] studied combinatorialproperties of eventually nonnegative matrices whose index is 0 or 1 by consideringtheir Frobenius normal forms. 
                         DOMINANT EV
                             Friedland [8] showed that for eventually nonnegative matrices the spectral radius is an eigenvalue. 
                                 Such an eigenvalue and any other eigenvalue whose modulus is equalto the spectral radius is called adominanteigenvalue. Furthermore, if a matrix hasonly one dominant eigenvalue (regardless of its multiplicity), then we call such aneigenvaluestrictly dominant.
                                 Eschenbach and Johnson [7] studied sign patterns of a matrix requiring the spectral radius to be an eigenvalue. They called such a propertythePerron property. 
                             We mention in passing the work of Rump [23], [24], who generalized the conceptof a positive dominant eigenvalue, but this is not related to the questions addressedin this paper.
                         EARLIER
                             Other earlier papers looking at issues relating to the spectralradius being an eigenvalue, at positive or nonnegative corresponding eigenvector, orat matrices with these properties,
                                  include [11], [12], [13], [16], [17], [19], [26], [27], [29].
                         EXTENDED PERRON PROPERTIES 
                             Different nomenclature for different “Perron properties” appear in the literature.In [7], as we already mentioned, thePerron propertystands for having the spectralradius as an eigenvalue, whereas, in [11] theweak Perron propertystands for havingthe spectral radius as a simple positive and strictly dominant eigenvalue. 
                             In [19],thePerron-Frobenius  propertystands for having the spectral radius as a positiveeigenvalue with a nonnegative eigenvector; this is also the definition used in [6].
                              Onthe other hand, in this paper we say that a real matrixApossesses thePerron-Frobenius propertyifρ(A) (whether it is zero or positive) is an eigenvalue ofAhavinga nonnegative eigenvector (which is the same as the definition introduced in [29]).
                                 Moreover, we say thatApossesses thestrong Perron-Frobenius propertyifAhas asimple, positive, and strictly dominant eigenvalue with a positive eigenvector (whichis the same as the definition introduced in [19]).

                         For a regular matrix pencil $$A-\lambda B$$ with a rank-factorisation $$B=LR^\top$$ we define the $$r\times r$$ matrix $$\Lambda:=R^\top \text{adj}(A)L$$. #definition

                         The $$\Lambda$$-matrices obtained from different rank-factorisations of the same matrix $$B$$ are related to each other through application of suitable similarity transformations. 
                         Proof.
                         If $$B=L_1 R_1^\top =L_2 R_2^\top$$, then $$\Lambda_1\sim \Lambda_2$$.

                             If $$A-\lambda B \sim \tilde{A}-\lambda \tilde{B} $$, then $$\Lambda=\tilde{\Lambda}$$.

                         If $$[A^{-1}?],L, R > 0$$ and $$\Lambda$$ has the strong PF property, then the regular matrix pencil $$A-\lambda LR^\top$$ has the strong PF property. 
                         If $$A,L_R^{-1}, R_R^{-1} > 0$$ and the regular matrix pencil $$A-\lambda LR^\top$$ has the strong PF property, then $$\Lambda$$ has the strong PF property.
                         If $$A,L,R>0$$ are inverse positive, then: the pencil has the strong PF property iff $$\Lambda$$ has the strong PF property. 
                             #theorem 
                     Proof of Theorem #slide 
                         Due to the definition of the $$\Lambda$$-matrix, we have
                             $$R^\top \text{adj}(A)L\cdot\Lambda=\det(R\top \text{adj}(A)L)\cdot I_r$$ #label:Lambda
                         We will denote $$\mu := \det(R^\top \text{adj}(A)L)$$ for ease of notation.
                         Let $$y>0$$ such that $$\Lambda y=\lambda y$$. We will assert that from this, we can derive a positive eigenvector for the pencil #label:the-pencil, for a suitable eigenvalue.
                          Define $$\tilde{y}= \text{adj}(A)Ly$$. Then we obtain
                             $$A \tilde{y}=A\; \text{adj}(A)Ly=\det(A)Ly$$. 
                         Furthermore, using #label:Lambda 
                             $$\mu y=R^\top \text{adj}(A)L\cdot \Lambda y=R^\top \text{adj}(A)L\cdot \lambda y$$.
                         Hence, putting this together, 
                             $$\mu A \tilde{y}=\det(A)LR^\top \text{adj}(A)L\cdot \lambda y=\det(A)\lambda B\tilde{y}\Longleftrightarrow (\mu A-\det(A)\lambda B)\tilde{y}=0$$.
                         We now distinguish three cases:
                             (i) Case $$\mu\neq 0, \det(A) \neq 0$$:
                                 We can see that $$\frac{\det(A)\lambda}{\mu}$$ is a finite nonzero eigenvalue, with positive eigenvector $$\tilde{y}$$.
                             (ii) Case $$\mu = 0, \det(A) \neq 0$$:
                                 In this case, we can see that $$\tilde{y}$$ is a positive eigenvector for an infinite eigenvalue. 
                             (iii) Case $$\mu \neq 0, \det(A) = 0$$:
                                 Consider $$a \neq 0$$ chosen so that $$\det(A + aLR^\top) \neq 0$$. 
                                 [..]
                                 This can be treated by Case (i) for the pencil $$A+ aLR^\top-\lambda LR^\top$$.
                                 Finally, we obtain that $$\tilde{y}$$ is a positive eigenvector for the eigenvalue $$0$$.
                             (iv) Case $$\mu = 0, \det(A) = 0$$:

                         The probabilistic algorithm for secret matrix share size reduction by \cite{Pfluegel2013-as}:
                             Inspired by previous matrix-based work, but avoid Jordan normal form
                             Propose a probabilistic algorithm, based on using companion form
                             We achieve similarly short shares as Yang and Zhao, but are more efficient
                             This yields a probabilistic online secret sharing scheme with small expected share size
                     Linear Algebra Concepts #slide 
                         Let us review some linear algebra concepts that will be used in the sequel.
                         Let $$A \in \mathbbm{F}_p^{t \times t}$$. The matrix $$A$$ is \emph{cyclic} iff it is similar to matrix in {\em companion form}
                             $$C =\left(\begin{array}{ccccc}0 & 1 & 0 & \ldots & 0 \\0 & 0 & 1 & \ddots & \vdots \\\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \ddots & 0 \\0 & 0 & \ldots & 0 & 1 \\c_{0} & c_{1} & \ldots & c_{t-2} & c_{t-1} \\\end{array}\right)$$.
                         Here, we have that
                             $$f (\lambda) = \lambda^{t} - c_{t-1} \lambda^{t-1} - \cdots- c_{1} \lambda - c_{0}$$
                         is the characteristic polynomial of $$C$$. 
                         For a cyclic matrix, we have that 
                             $$f(\lambda) = \det(C- \lambda I) = \det(A- \lambda I) = m(\lambda)$$ 
                         where $$m(\lambda)$$ is the minimal polynomial of $$A$$.
                     Cyclic Vectors and a Probability Result #slide 
                         If $$A$$ is cyclic, we can use standard linear algebra techniques  to compute $$C$$
                         Algorithm Cyclic\_Vector($$A$$)
                             [(1)] $$v_0:=$$ random vector
                             [(2)] {\bf for} $$i=1$$ {\bf to} $$t-1$$: compute $$v_i:=v_{i-1}A$$
                             [(3)] {\bf if} $$v_0, \ldots, v_{t-1}$$ are linearly independent {\bf then return} \emph{$$v_0$$} {\bf else return} {\em FAIL}
                     Research Question #slide 
                         Question: given a secret $$s$$, and a randomly chosen prime number $$p$$, we can convert $$s$$ to a matrix. How likely is this to induce a random cyclic matrix?
                         \begin{proposition}[Neumann et al., 1994]
                         If a matrix $$A$$ and a vector $$v$$ are chosen at random, then the probability that $$A$$ is cyclic and $$v$$ is a cyclic vector for $$A$$ is $$(1-p^{-1})(1-p^{-2})\cdots(1-p^{-t}) $$ .
                         \end{proposition}
                     Matrix Share Size Reduction Algorithm #slide 
                         This probabilistic algorithm splits secret $$s$$ into public part $$P$$ and (short) secret part $$Q$$
                         We use repeated matrix conversion, with increasing prime numbers
                         Algorithm MSSR($$s$$)
                             [(1)] $$p:=2$$
                             [(2)] /* Conversion of secret */
                                 [(a)] $$p:=$$ next\_prime$$(p)$$
                                 [(b)] Compute the base-$$p$$ digits of $$s$$
                                 [(c)] Convert secret $$s$$ into a $$t \times t$$ matrix $$S$$ by using these digits (padding with 0 if necessary)
                             [(3)] /* Size reduction step */
                                 [(a)] Attempt to compute cyclic vector $$v$$
                                 [(b)] If not successful, go to Step (2)
                                 [(c)] Construct similarity transformation $$T$$ such that $$C := T^{-1}S T$$ is a companion matrix
                             [(4)] Put $$P := T$$ and $$Q := [c_0, c_1, \ldots, c_{t-1}, p]$$
                     An Online Secret Sharing Scheme #slide 
                         We use the MSSR algorithm for an online secret sharing scheme with public and secret data
                         {Share creation}:
                             Compute $$P$$ and $$Q$$ using MSSR algorithm
                             Publish $$P$$
                             Share $$Q$$, using any space efficient secret sharing scheme
                         {Reconstruction of secret}:
                             Reconstruct the characteristic polynomial $$f$$ and the value of $$p$$ by acquiring at least $$k$$ shares
                             Build $$C$$ from the $$t$$ coefficients of $$f$$
                             Compute $$S$$ from $$C$$, by using the public transformation $$T$$ as $$S = T C T ^{-1}$$
                             Reconstruct $$s$$ from $$S$$ and $$p$$
