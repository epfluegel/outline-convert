        <outline text="**Scenario**">
            <outline text="Agouti Software has acquired the right to develop an app, the idea of which was conceived by a programmer who spent a year at Agouti on a university placement, and will now head the team producing the app, in a newly created business unit of Agouti."/>
            <outline text="**The Product**">
                <outline text="The YouAre mobile app employs deep learning algorithms to help the user recognise acquaintances such as business contacts and colleagues, whose names they may not remember."/>
                <outline text="Ideally, YouAre will be used with AR glasses with eye tracking technology. When running, it will display the name of the owner of the face that the user is looking at. It could also be used with a smartphone, in which case the user will need to position the camera so that the subject's face is in the centre of the frame."/>
                <outline text="All AI functionality is performed on the remote server; the data required to recognise the target's face is sent from the device to the server, and the server responds with the name. This is then displayed to the user."/>
                <outline text="For face recognition, salient facial features plus the identity of the individual (as provided by the user) are recorded and stored in a central networked database."/>
                <outline text="Although the app was conceived as an aid to people whose memory fails to reliably recall names of (potentially many) other people, it may prove to be an attractive addition to Agouti Software's customer relationship management (CRM) suite. As such, a premium version, with a larger capacity personal contact list and integration with the CRM software, will be offered in the future."/>
            </outline>
            <outline text="**The Development Team**">
                <outline text="In addition to the team leader, three developers and one systems administrator will work on the initial project."/>
                <outline text="They will rent an office designed for small businesses and tech startups, and access the Agouti server remotely. "/>
            </outline>
        </outline>
        <outline text="**Task**">
            <outline text="Because of the nature of the data stored and transmitted for this application, Agouti Software management require a security assessment to be carried out for all systems connected with the YouAre app."/>
            <outline text="You are in charge of leading the security assessment activity for the organisation, based on using the `OCTAVE` approach. Note while normally, for small organisations, you would use `OCTAVE-S`, for this activity you can still use standard `OCTAVE`."/>
            <outline text="Rather than writing a full report, it is sufficient to create notes, in the form of short sentences or paragraphs, and outlines (bulleted lists)."/>
