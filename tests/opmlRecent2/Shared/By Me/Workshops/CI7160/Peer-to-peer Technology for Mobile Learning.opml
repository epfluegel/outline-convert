        <outline text="Read the following description of a fictitious case study, and answer the questions below."/>
        <outline text="A university uses peer-to-peer technology in order to enable the sharing of electronic documents of students, participating in an interactive tutorial session, using their smartphones. In order to join the session, students use an app on their mobile phone, which set up the security scheme. Each student will need to use public key cryptography in order to send confidential messages to other users, and to digitally (authenticate) messages sent from their phones."/>
        <outline text="Consider a scenario, where each student is required to create a public and private key when enrolling at the University, and to upload the public key to a central repository. An appropriate key management protocol retrieves the public key whenever needed. Discuss advantages and disadvantages of the scheme, when considering the context of the case study.">
            <outline text="Hint: in order to proceed with your discussion for this scenario, you may ask yourself some questions, following the standard security assessment methodology.">

        <outline text="Finally, they are using a security scheme based on threshold cryptography (i.e., using secret sharing). A student wishing to join the group simply chooses an available seat in the proximity of at least $$t$$ other students with smartphones and, through his phone, he is able to securely receive a share of the group's private key, and also its public key - this is implemented using a Bluetooth link. Assume that an appropriate choice of parameters $$(t, n)$$ has been made, and that the system has been bootstrapped prior to the session.">
