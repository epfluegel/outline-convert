<outline text="ACTIVITY 2">
    <outline text="In this lab, you will use Metasploit to target a Windows XP virtual machine as a practical example of a client side exploit. Client side exploits take advantage of application software installed on network clients, and typically require user interaction (such as executing a file, or visiting a malicious website) to successfully exploit a target. While this is a legacy exploit, it does represent a good model of the fundamental interactions that take place between an attacker and a target."/>
    <outline text="Requirements for is lab"/>
    <outline text="For this activity, you will require:">
        <outline text="Completion of the “Getting Started with Metasploit Lab” activity."/>
        <outline text="A Kali Linux virtual machine. This will be used as the attacker."/>
        <outline text="A Windows XP virtual machine. This will be used as the target."/>
        <outline text="Two IP addresses that were assigned to you in previous sessions. They should in the 192.168.192.x subnet, where x represents two sequential numbers that are unique to you."/>
        <outline text="Decide if you will use your own Windows XP virtual machine as a target or someone else’s.  This is easily achieved by using someone else’s Windows XP IP address."/>
    </outline>
    <outline text="SETUP THE VIRTUAL MACHINES"/>
    <outline text="If you already have the virtual machines required, you do not need to complete this section."/>
    <outline text="1. Open a terminal and type"/>
    <outline text="The following screen should be displayed:"/>
    <outline text="2. Use the arrow keys on the keyboard to select the virtual machine that you want to install"/>
    <outline text="(e.g. kali-Linux-2018.4-vbox-amd64.ovf or xp.ovf ) and press the ENTER key and you should be prompted to enter a name for the virtual machine that you want to create, as shown in the example below:"/>
    <outline text="3. Enter a name for your VM and press the ENTER key. You should the following prompt:"/>
    <outline text="4. Type the letter y and press the ENTER key. The installation process for this virtual machine should begin. It is a short process and once complete your terminal display should be similar to the example shown below:"/>
    <outline text="5. Repeat steps 1 – 5 relative to any additional virtual machines that you need to deploy (e.g. for this activity you will need to repeat steps 1 – 4 to deploy a Windows XP VM."/>
    <outline text="6. Once you have completed the installation of both virtual machines, start them."/>

    <outline text="d) Password: abc123"/>
    <outline text="CONFIGURE THE VIRTUAL MACHINES"/>
    <outline text="Both virtual machines need to be on the same subnet and each of them will need to be configured to use one of the IP address that has been assigned to you. The first step is to ensure that both virtual machines are using a Bridged Adapter connection. This can be achieved by way of following example:"/>
    <outline text="Configure a static IP address for Kali"/>
    <outline text="Complete the following steps as indicated in the sequence of screenshots below, in order to set a static IP address on your Kali virtual machine."/>
    <outline text="7. Open a terminal in Kali and at the command prompt:"/>

    <outline text="c) ping the IP address of your Kali virtual machine"/>
    <outline text="11. From your Kali machine, ensure that you can ping the Windows XP virtual machine"/>
    <outline text="USING METASPLOIT EXPLOIT"/>
    <outline text="We will be using an exploit called CVE2008-2992, which is an Adobe Acrobat Reader 8.1.2 vulnerability. Visit http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/30035 to gain an insight to the vulnerability. After reading the vulnerability disclosure bulletin, we discover that it involves the util.printf() javascript function used by this version of Adobe Acrobat Reader."/>
    <outline text="On your Kali machine"/>
    <outline text="12. Ensure that the postgres database is started and that you have a user connected to the msf_database. If you are not sure how to complete these steps, complete the “Getting started with Metasploit Lab” activity."/>
    <outline text="13. Open a terminal and launch an Metasploit session by typing:"/>
    <outline text="14. From msfconsole prompt, search for the util.printf() javascript exploit, by typing:"/>
    <outline text="The result will be similar to the screen shown below."/>
    <outline text="15. Now type:"/>
    <outline text="The result will be similar to the screen shown below."/>
    <outline text="16. We then select the meterpreter payload as our malicious payload to embed into our PDF file. This is the payload that is executed on the victim's machine when they open the file. Type:"/>
    <outline text="The result will be similar to the screen shown below."/>
    <outline text="17. Type the following:"/>
    <outline text="The result will be similar to the screen shown below."/>
    <outline text="18. Type the following:"/>
    <outline text="The result will be similar to the screen shown below."/>
    <outline text="19. Type the following:"/>
    <outline text="Where “afilename.pdf” can be a name of your choice. Avoid names with spaces and be sure to include the “.pdf” extension."/>
    <outline text="The result will be similar to the screen shown below."/>
    <outline text="20. This specific exploit does not require target selection. It will create a PDF file with our embedded payload. Metasploit will not execute the exploit against any specific target. Once all options are set, run the exploit to create your malicious PDF, type:"/>
    <outline text="The result will be similar to the screen shown below."/>
    <outline text="21. Open a new terminal in the KaliVM and start the apache server by typing:"/>
    <outline text="The result will be similar to the screen shown below."/>
    <outline text="22. Then, in the same terminal as above, move your exploit (your malicious PDF) to the apache web root by typing the following:"/>
    <outline text="The result will be similar to the screen shown below."/>
    <outline text="23. In order to &quot;catch&quot; the payload, once the client opens the file, we need a service waiting for the incoming connection on Kali. We will use Metasploit's Multi-Handler to provide this service. Back on the msfconsole terminal, type the following to start the multi-handler:"/>
    <outline text="The result will be similar to the screen shown below."/>
    <outline text="24. Type the following:"/>
    <outline text="The results for commands 24, 24 and 26 are captured in the screen shot below."/>
    <outline text="25. Once all options are set properly, run the handler by typing:"/>
    <outline text="We are now ready to receive the call-back connection from the victim, which will be made once the user opens our malicious PDF."/>
    <outline text="ON XP VM (VICTIM):"/>
    <outline text="26. Open a web browser that visit the IP address of the Kali virtual machine and the pdf file that you created. For example: http:// 192.168.x.x/afilename.pdf"/>
    <outline text="ON KALI LINUX (ATTACKER):"/>
    <outline text="Once the Meterpreter payload calls back (which can take a minute, so don't panic), and sends the Meterpreter reverse shell, we move on to post exploit mode. Eventually, the following screen should be displayed."/>
    <outline text="27. We will now migrate our shell to a stable process in case the victim closes the exploited application (pdf file reader in our case). To determine which PID (process id) to use type:"/>
    <outline text="This will display all the processes currently running and the PIDs associated with them. See the example below:"/>
    <outline text="28. To migrate our shell to a stable process, identify the PID (PPID) of a system process (or an essential user process like explorer.exe) and type:"/>
    <outline text="…where system-process-ID is a PID that you have identified. For example, migrate 1664 is used in the example below."/>
    <outline text="29. The final step is to enable Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) on the victim machine. Type:"/>
    <outline text="The result will be similar to the screen shown below."/>
    <outline text="30. Next, we can drop into a Windows command prompt by typing:"/>
    <outline text="The result will be similar to the screen shown below."/>
    <outline text="31. Create a local user account using a name of your own choice:"/>
    <outline text="The result below shows an example, using the name hacker."/>
    <outline text="32. Add this account to the local Administrators group by typing:"/>
    <outline text="The result will be similar to the screen shown below."/>
    <outline text="33. You can also add this user to the local “Remote Desktop Users” group, so we can connect via RDP (remote desktop protocol) into the target machine. Type:"/>
    <outline text="The result will be similar to the screen shown below."/>
    <outline text="34. Exit the Windows command prompt to get back to the meterpreter shell. Type:"/>
    <outline text="35. We then hide our malicious user account by typing:"/>
    <outline text="36. Finally, we connect to the target machine via RDP, and login with the credentials we created in the previous steps. Open a new terminal in the Kali VM and type:"/>

<outline text="Agouti Software has acquired the right to develop an app, the idea of which was conceived by a programmer who spent a year at Agouti on a university placement, and will now head the team producing the app, in a newly created business unit of Agouti."/>
<outline text="**The Product**">
    <outline text="The YouAre mobile app employs deep learning algorithms to help the user recognise acquaintances such as business contacts and colleagues, whose names they may not remember."/>
    <outline text="Ideally, YouAre will be used with AR glasses with eye tracking technology. When running, it will display the name of the owner of the face that the user is looking at. It could also be used with a smartphone, in which case the user will need to position the camera so that the subject's face is in the centre of the frame."/>
    <outline text="All AI functionality is performed on the remote server; the data required to recognise the target's face is sent from the device to the server, and the server responds with the name. This is then displayed to the user."/>
    <outline text="For face recognition, salient facial features plus the identity of the individual (as provided by the user) are recorded and stored in a central networked database."/>
    <outline text="Although the app was conceived as an aid to people whose memory fails to reliably recall names of (potentially many) other people, it may prove to be an attractive addition to Agouti Software's customer relationship management (CRM) suite. As such, a premium version, with a larger capacity personal contact list and integration with the CRM software, will be offered in the future."/>
</outline>
<outline text="**The Development Team**">
    <outline text="In addition to the team leader, three developers and one systems administrator will work on the initial project."/>
    <outline text="They will rent an office designed for small businesses and tech startups, and access the Agouti server remotely. "/>
</outline>
                            </outline>
                            <outline text="**Task**">
<outline text="Because of the nature of the data stored and transmitted for this application, Agouti Software management require a security assessment to be carried out for all systems connected with the YouAre app."/>
<outline text="You are in charge of leading the security assessment activity for the organisation, based on using the `OCTAVE` approach. Note while normally, for small organisations, you would use `OCTAVE-S`, for this activity you can still use standard `OCTAVE`."/>
<outline text="Rather than writing a full report, it is sufficient to create notes, in the form of short sentences or paragraphs, and outlines (bulleted lists)."/>

In particular, (A1) password guessing attacks, (A2) rainbow table or other pre-image attacks on hash functions, (A3) replay and (A4) man-in-the-middle attacks are all threatening the scheme. In this exercise, we will see how we can address at least some of these attacks. "/>
                            <outline text="(a) Why does sending $$h(user || pwd)$$, where user is the unique username and pwd the password of Alice, make attack A1 (and A2) more difficult? ">
<outline text="Since there should now be no duplicates in the password file anymore, it would make it more difficult for someone who has access to the password file, to guess the password. #item  #answer "/>
<outline text="It would also make a dictionary attack on the server more difficult as weak passwords containing dictionary words, are not the sole input to the hash function anymore. #item #answer "/>
                            </outline>
                            <outline text="(b) Now consider the following more sophisticated authentication scheme:">
<outline text="The server initiates by sending a random value $$N_S$$. #item  "/>
<outline text="Client Alice responds by sending $$h(h(user || pwd) || N_S)$$ and $$N_S$$. #item  "/>
<outline text="Server checks whether he can compute the first hash digest value, and checks the integrity of $$N_S$$. #item  "/>
                            </outline>
                            <outline text="Against which attacks (A1-A4) does this protect, and why? Which attacks does it not address? Hint: check out RFC 2069, available on the Internet. ">
<outline text="This uses a server nonce in order to strengthen the protocol. This makes attacks A1 and A2 even more difficult due to additional randomness in the input of the hash function. It also helps to prevent replay attacks A3 on the protocol since each client reply is now unique to each transaction and hence not valid, if it was replayed from a previous session. #answer  "/>
<outline text="However, a man-in-the-middle attack A4 is still possible, provided the man in the middle captures all the different requests and responses. #answer  "/>

                            <outline text="1. Review all the passwords you have to maintain for your own use. Group these passwords into categories, for example `personal`, `study`, `work` etc. ">
<outline text="Try to not have too many categories, around 5 is probably a good number. Write down your categories. Also, note the user accounts that fall into the categories (based on your initial passwords, do not write down these passwords however). You might find that you cannot remember the exact username anymore. Try to look them up/reconstruct them, and write them down."/>
                            </outline>
                            <outline text="2. For each category, devise a catchphrase. ">
<outline text="Remember that a catchphrase is a sentence in natural language, easy to remember. You should not feel that you have the need to write this down or store it in a password-protected file. In order to make this feasible, relate catchphrases to their specific category. So for example, a catchphrase for your `personal` category could be `I'm grateful for my life!`."/>
                            </outline>
                            <outline text="3. Now design a scheme how to derive a password from a catchphrase. ">
<outline text="The scheme should depend on the specific user account name that requires the corresponding password. ">
    <outline text="For example, your scheme could be to omit vowels from the catchphrase, add the characters `$` and `*`, followed by the last character of the username (this will make it specific for each account)."/>

                            </outline>
                            <outline text="4. Apply your scheme to all your user accounts. ">
<outline text="This should, in most cases, give you passwords that are all different and that you do not need to write down. "/>
<outline text="Provided you remember the catchphrase and your scheme, you will always be able to reconstruct the passwords if required. This scheme certainly works very well for me!"/>
