                 __Motive__: the underlying reason for attacking the victim. 
                     This could be for the purposes of financial gains, revenge, personal satisfaction or thrill, or simply with the intention of creating damage. From a psychological point of view, the attacker's motive might affect the perceived gain, as well as the appreciation of the effort required.
                 __Ability__: the capability of the attacker to invest in resources for implementing the attack, as well as the technical knowledge available for breaching cyber security controls. 
                     A strong ability will make it easier to spend effort on the attack, and subjectively reducing the perceived value of $e$.
                 __Exploitability__: the ease by which the system can be penetrated, through exploiting a vulnerability. 
                     It would be reasonable to expect exploitability and effort to be inversely related in a proportional manner. This category could be explored similarly as in the CVSS exploitability score, taking into account possible attack vectors and attack complexities, as well as the required privileges and interaction with users, however, the discussion should not be restricted to software vulnerabilities alone.
                 __Visibility of target__: how prominent is the target, for example, does it have a popular website or brand name, does it have a large user base? 
                     Great visibility might promise a big gain, in the eyes of the attacker.
                 __Attractiveness of target__: from the point of view of the attacker, how attractive is the target? 
                     This is linked to how much gain the attacker would estimate from achieving through the attack, and will strongly depend on the specific motive, as discussed in the first category.

                     MC2 Linear Programs
                 MC2 Linear Program Formulation #slide 
                     MC2 LP:
                         Consider
                             "$$\max C^\top y+d$$" subject to "$$Ay\le B$$" and $$y\ge 0$$ ($$d>0$$). 
                         This means
                             $$\exist\, x,y^0\ge 0:\; z=x(C^\top y + d)$$ maximal s.t. $$Ay \le By^o,\; y\ge 0$$.

                 Necessary Conditions: Augmented Form #slide 
                     We view the linear system of inequalities used in the MC2 LP as a system of linear matrix equations.
                     This can be written using non-basic and basic variables as
                         $$Ay+\hat{y}=By^o$$
                         $$x^o(C^\top y+d)=v$$
                     where $$y\ge 0,\hat{y}\ge 0,y^o\ge 0$$.
                 Constructing A Basic Solution #slide 
                     We can construct a basic solution that may be infeasible, or not even real, given as follows:
                         Let $$\lambda\neq 0$$ be an eigenvalue of $$D$$ with corresponding eigenvectors $$\hat{x}^\top, \hat{y}$$ and define $$\hat{v}=1/\lambda$$. 
                         Subject to the substitution $$A\leftarrow A+aD$$ for a suitable positive real number $$a$$ we can assume $$\Re(\hat{v})>0$$. 
                         Then $$(\hat{v},\hat{x}^\top, \hat{y})$$ is a generalised eigensystem of $$I-\lambda{D}$$. 
                         Set $$x^o=\hat{x}B$$, $$y=0$$, $$v=x^od$$ and $$y^o=C^\top \hat{y}$$.

                             The algorithm views the linear system of equations used in the dual simplex method as a bilinear linear matrix pencil equation. 
                             This can be written using non-basic and basic variables as

                             Assumptions
                                 The matrix pencil $$A-\lambda {bc^\top}$$ is regular.
                                 The unique finite eigenvalue of this regular matrix pencil is positive. 
                                 Note: this excludes the case where $$bc^\top$$ is nilpotent.

                         Initialisation #slide #simplex:init 
                             We start with $$x=y=0$$, $$v=0$$ and a basic solution that may be infeasible, given as follows:
                                 Let $$\lambda\neq 0$$ be an eigenvalue of $$D$$ with corresponding eigenvectors $$\hat{x}^\top, \hat{y}$$ and define $$\hat{v}=1/\lambda$$. 
                                 Then $$(\hat{v},\hat{x}^\top, \hat{y})$$ is a generalised eigensystem of $$I-\lambda{D}$$. 
                                 Subject to the substitution $$A\leftarrow A+aD$$ for a suitable real number $$a$$ we can assume $$\hat{v}>0$$. 
                         Reduction Step (I) #slide #simplex:pivot 
                             We partition the matrix $$A$$ into $$rs$$ blocks ($$1\le r \le m$$, $$1\le s \le n$$), with matching row and column dimensions:
                                 $$A=\begin{pmatrix} A_{11} & \cdots & A_{1j} & \cdots & A_{1s} \\ \vdots &  & \vdots &  & \vdots \\ A_{i1} & \cdots & A_{ij} & \cdots & A_{is} \\ \vdots &  & \vdots &  & \vdots \\A_{r1} & \cdots & A_{rj} & \cdots & A_{rs} \\ \end{pmatrix}$$
                             Let $$B$$ and $$C^\top$$ be partitioned accordingly
                             We can pick a block-index pair $$(i,j)$$ as block-pivot, if $$A_{ij}$$ is square and $$A_{ij}-\lambda B_{ij}C_{ij}^\top$$ is a regular matrix pencil with at least one real, positive eigenvalue $$\mu$$ and corresponding eigenvectors $$x^\top_\mu, y_\mu$$ that are not both nonnegative

                                 The new matrices $$\tilde{A}$$ and $$\tilde{B}$$ are obtained through left-multiplication of a suitable matrix $$P$$ and swapping basic and non-basic variables

                         Consider the model VNM($$D,A$$) where $$D=BC^\top \geqq 0$$.
                         We refer to this as a rank-1 VN model.
                         It is known in the literature \cite{Bidard2000-jr}, that such a model is equivalent to a linear program.
                         Theorem: the rank-one model VNM($$uv^\top,A$$) with maximal growth factor $$\lambda>0$$ is equivalent to the linear program LP($$v^\top, A, u$$) with optimal value $$\lambda^{-1}$$. #theorem

                             We start with $$\lambda$$ maximal such that $$\exists x,y\in \R^{n}: x^\top(A-\lambda UV^\top)\geqq 0$$.
                             Define $$\tilde{X} := \lambda^{-1} {(X^\top U)}^{-1}X^\top$$.
                             Then $$\tilde{X}u=\frac{X^\top U}{\lambda X^\top U}=\lambda^{-1}$$ is minimal, such that $$\tilde{X}^\top(A-\lambda UV^\top)=\tilde{X}^\top A-V^\top \geqq 0$$.
                             This means that the multi-linear multi-criteria program MLC($$U, A, V^\top$$) is solved by $$\tilde{X}^\top$$ with value $$\lambda^{-1}$$.
                         "$$\Longleftarrow$$" 
                             Assume $${X}^\top$$ is a solution of the multi-linear multi-criteria program MLC($$U, A, V^\top$$) with value $$\mu^{}$$.
                             This means $$\mu := X^\top u$$ is minimal such that $$X^\top A-V^\top\geqq 0$$.
                             One has $$V^\top=(X^\top U)^{-1}X^\top UV^\top = \mu^{-1}X^\top UV^\top \geqq 0$$. 
                             Hence $$X^\top(A-\mu^{-1} UV^\top)\geqq 0$$ and $$\lambda:=\mu^{-1}$$ is a maximal growth factor for VNM($$UV^\top,A$$).

                     Background:
                         The concept of a Blockchain has experienced a tremendous interest, ever since the inception of Bitcoin as a pioneering Blockchain application
                     Context:
                         Kindly, there is a huge debate whether Blockchains will eventually become mainstream applications
                     Motivation:
                         There are some crucial aspects of mainstream Blockchain systems, that require addressing
                     Summary:
                         use of innovative cryptographic techniques with a focus on secret sharing and steganography
                 Aims and Research Questions #slide 
                     This line of research aims to improve the security and dependability of blockchain architectures by addressing scalability, storage requirements, performance and refinements of the mainstream security goals of confidentiality, integrity and availability. 
                     A central research question is how to use cryptographic techniques other than encryption, to add features and improve the above-mentioned aspects for blockchain architectures that are not met by mainstream implementations. 
                 Challenges #slide 
                     The main challenge in this research domain is creating practical impact based on implementations suitable for real-world deployment. 
                     Another challenge is to find poignant blockchain applications compatible with proposed prototype security architectures, offering functionality for novel use cases. 
                 Outlook #slide 
                     At this point, further diversification of additional cryptographic schemes proposed for the use for the blockchain is expected. 
                     However, it is unclear when these initiatives will substantially and positively impact current mainstream systems. 
                     Still, a clear potential exists, which will continue to motivate researchers in this area to put their efforts into ongoing projects.

                             Introduced by Jacobson (1937) as a unifying framework for linear differential and difference equations/systems 
                             Computer Algebra use by e.g. Bronstein \& Petkovsek (1996), Bronstein (2000), Barkatou (2006) and Barkatou, Broughton \& Pfluegel (2008, 2010)
                         Concepts #slide 
                             We need some notations:
                                 $$F$$ a field
                                 $$\phi$$ a $$K$$-automorphism of $$F$$
                                 $$\delta$$ a pseudo-derivation w.r.t. $$\phi$$, i.e.
                                     $$\delta(fg) = \delta f \phi g + f\delta g$$
                             One can show: if $$\phi \neq \text{id}$$, then $$\exists \gamma \in F: \delta = \gamma(\phi - \text{id})$$.
                                 
                     Systems of Pseudo-Linear Equations #h 
                         Introduction #slide 
                             System of Pseudo-Linear Equations:
                                 $$\delta Y(\tau) = A(\tau) \phi Y(\tau)$$
                             with $$A \in F^{n \times n}$$. This unifies common types of linear functional equations.
                             If $$\phi \neq \text{id}$$, the system can be represented in different formats:
                                 $$\phi Y(\tau) = A(\tau) Y(\tau)$$
                             or
                                 $$\delta Y(\tau) = A(\tau) Y(\tau)$$.
                             Conversions between formats can be done efficiently.

                             Aims and Objectives #slide 
                                 Ultimate aim: efficiently compute symbolic solutions of systems of linear functional equations.
                                 Objectives:
                                     To give a unifying theoretical framework for defining irregular parts of formal solutions.
                                     To provide a generic algorithm that can compute irregular parts efficiently.
                                 This is joint work with M. Barkatou and G. Broughton.

                                         Additional notations:
                                             $$F = K((\tau))$$
                                             $$v: F\longrightarrow \Z\cup\{\infty\}$$ a valuation defined by
                                                 $$v(f) = \left \{\begin{array}{lcl} m & \mbox{if }& f=\tau^{m}(f_{0}+f_{1}\tau + \ldots), f_{0} \neq 0, \\ \infty & \mbox{if }& f = 0. \end{array}\right.$$
                                             $$\omega \in \Z$$ defined by $$\omega(\D) =v(\delta(\tau)) - v(\tau)$$.
                                         Also assume $$v(\phi(f)) = v(f) \;\;\;\forall f \in F$$. 
                                         A singular system of pseudo-linear equations is:
                                             $$\tau^{r-\omega}\delta Y(\tau) = A(\tau) \phi Y(\tau)$$
                                         with $$r \in \N$$ (the \emph{Poincar\'{e}-rank}) and $$A \in K[[\tau]]^{n \times n}$$.

                                         We define the quantities $$c, q \in K^{\ast}$$ from the definition of $$\phi$$ and $$\delta$$:

                                         We then have inductively for $$h \in \N^{+}$$

                         A Best Response Lemma #slide 
                             The proof of the theorem will be aided by the following lemma. 
                             It exhibits a special case arising where there exists a strategy of one player to which any strategy of the other player is a best response.
                             #lemma:best-response-eigen
                                 Following the notations as in the theorem, we have for a nonnegative left eigenvector $$x_{\mu_B}$$ that for all Player 2 strategies $$y$$ it holds $$x^\top_{\mu_B} B y = \mu_B $$. Similarly, a nonnegative right eigenvector $$y_{\mu_A}$$ satisfies $$x^\top A y_{\mu_A} = \mu_A$$ for all Player 1 strategies $$x$$.
                                 Using set notation, $$ \mathcal{BR}(y_{\mu_A})=X$$ and $$ \mathcal{BR}(x_{\mu_B})=Y$$.
                         Proof [of lemma] #slide 
                             #proof 
                                 Assume that $$x^{\top}_{\mu_A}\ge 0$$ is a left eigenvector, associated with the eigenvalue $${\mu_A}$$ of the regular matrix pencil $$A-\lambda E$$. This implies
                                 #equation:left-nullspace-eq
                                      $$ x^{\top}_{\mu_A}(A-{\mu_A} E)=0. $$
                                 Due to the normalisation property $$\sum x_{{\mu_A},i}=1$$ we have $$ x^{\top}_{\mu_A} E = x^{\top}_{\mu_A} ee^{\top}=e^{\top}$$ so that equation #ref:left-nullspace-eq implies 
                                     $$ x^{\top}_{\mu_A} A = {\mu_A} e^{\top}$$.  #displaymaths 
                                 The second property for a right eigenvector $$y_{\mu_B}$$ can be shown similarly. From this, the lemma follows. 
                         Proof [of Theorem #ref:bimatrix-regular-theorem ] #slide 
                             Let $$y_{\mu_A}$$ be nonnegative right eigenvector of $$A-\lambda E$$ with respect to the eigenvalue $$\mu_A$$. From Lemma #ref:best-response-lemma we deduce that $$y_{\mu_A}$$ is a best response to any Player 1 strategy $$x$$, in particular to  $$x=x_{\mu_B}$$. Likewise,  denote $$x_{\mu_B}$$ a nonnegative left eigenvector of $$B-\lambda E$$. We obtain that  $$x_{\mu_B}$$ is a best response to Player 2 strategy $$y=y_{\mu_A}$$. Hence these strategies are mutual best responses and by definition mixed Nash Equilibrium strategies with payoffs $$\mu_A$$ and $$\mu_B$$ as required. #proof

                                     If a bimatrix game is completely mixed and $$v_A=0$$, the cofactors $$A_{i1},\ldots,A_{in}$$ of the matrix $$A$$ are either all zero or have the same sign, for all $$1\le i\le n$$. If $$v_B=0$$, the same property holds for the cofactors $$B_{1j},\ldots,B_{nj}$$ of the matrix $$B$$, for all $$1\le j\le n$$. 
                                 #proof 
                                     Based on [Raghavan, Theorem 1], using a technique similar to that in the proof for [Kaplanski, Theorem 4]

                                 The characteristic polynomial is $$c_A(\lambda)=\det(A-\lambda E)$$.

                                     We have $$c_A(\lambda)=c_1\lambda -c_0$$ where $$c_0=\det A$$ and $$c_1=\sum_{ij}A_{ij}$$ with $$A_{ij}$$ the cofactor of $$a_{ij}$$.  
                                 #proof 
                                     The degree of $$c_A$$ is bound by rank($$E)=1$$
                                     Formula for $$c_0$$ is clear (put $$\lambda=0$$)
                                     The remaining fact follows by considering the expansion of the determinant $$\det A'=\sum_{ij}a_{ij}A'_{ij}$$ in a sum of terms
                                     For each $$i,j$$, there is a $$\lambda$$ exactly once per term

                         The fundamental relationship between generalised eigensystems associated with a bimatrix game --- under the assumption of certain sufficient conditions --- and an equilibrium strategy of the game is established in this section. 
                         This extends results by @THOMPSON to bimatrix games. 
                         #theorem:bimatrix-regular-theorem
                             Given a square bimatrix game $$G=(A,B)$$, assume the matrix pencils $$A-\lambda E$$  and $$B-\lambda E$$ are both regular, each with a real generalised eigenvalue $$\mu_A$$ and $$\mu_B$$ respectively. Let $$x_{\mu_B}$$ be a nonnegative left generalised eigenvector of $$B-\lambda E$$ with respect to $$\mu_B$$ and denote $$y_{\mu_A}$$ a nonnegative right generalised eigenvector of $$A-\lambda E$$ with respect to $$\mu_A$$. Then $$(x^*,y^*) = (x_{\mu_B}$$, $$y_{\mu_A}$$) is a Nash Equilibrium strategy profile of the game $$G$$ and $$(\mu_A, \mu_B)$$ is the corresponding game value pair.
                         The proof of the theorem will be aided by the following lemma. It exhibits a special case arising where there exists a strategy of one player to which any strategy of the other player is a best response.
                         #lemma:best-response
                             Following the notations as in the theorem, we have for a nonnegative left generalised eigenvector $$x_{\mu_B}$$ that for all Player 2 strategies $$y$$ it holds $$x^\top_{\mu_B} B y = \mu_B $$. Similarly, a nonnegative right generalised eigenvector $$y_{\mu_A}$$ satisfies $$x^\top A y_{\mu_A} = \mu_A$$ for all Player 1 strategies $$x$$.
                         #proof 
                             Assume that $$x^{\top}_{\mu_A}\ge 0$$ is a left generalised eigenvector, associated with the generalised eigenvalue $${\mu_A}$$ of the regular matrix pencil $$A-\lambda E$$. This implies
                             #equation:left-nullspace-eq
                                  $$ x^{\top}_{\mu_A}(A-{\mu_A} E)=0. $$
                             Due to the normalisation property $$\sum x_{{\mu_A},i}=1$$ we have $$ x^{\top}_{\mu_A} E = x^{\top}_{\mu_A} ee^{\top}=e^{\top}$$ so that equation #ref:left-nullspace-eq implies 
                                 $$ x^{\top}_{\mu_A} A = {\mu_A} e^{\top}$$.  #displaymaths 
                             The second property for a right generalised eigenvector $$y_{\mu_B}$$ can be shown similarly. From this, the lemma follows. 
                         The proof of Theorem #bimatrix-regular-theorem.ref can now be stated as follows. 
                         #proof
                             Let $$y_{\mu_A}$$ be nonnegative right generalised eigenvector of $$A-\lambda E$$ with respect to the generalised eigenvalue $$\mu_A$$. From Lemma #ref:best-response-lemma we deduce that $$y_{\mu_A}$$ is a best response to any Player 1 strategy $$x$$, in particular to  $$x=x_{\mu_B}$$. Likewise,  denote $$x_{\mu_B}$$ a nonnegative left generalised eigenvector of $$B-\lambda E$$. We obtain that  $$x_{\mu_B}$$ is a best response to Player 2 strategy $$y=y_{\mu_A}$$. Hence these strategies are mutual best responses and by definition mixed Nash Equilibrium strategies with payoffs $$\mu_A$$ and $$\mu_B$$ as required. #proof 
                         This result can also be used in order to construct an explicite solution formula, generalising a result of Thompson et al in the matrix game case. Karlin

                     The Completely Mixed Case #h 
                         The use of generalised eigensystems to characterise a completely mixed equilibrium strategy turns out to be a natural approach, as suggested by the following
                         #theorem:bimatrix-weakly-mixed
                             A bimatrix game is weakly completely mixed iff its associated generalised eigensystems $$\mathcal{E}_A$$ and $$\mathcal{E}_B$$ are both regular, with corresponding real generalised eigenvalues $$\mu_A$$ and $$\mu_B$$ respectively, and strictly positive right generalised eigenvector $$y_{\mu_A}$$ (left generalised eigenvector $$x_{\mu_B}$$ respectively). 
                         #proof
                             __The conditions are necessary.__  This shall be proven in a number of steps. 
                                 The following theorem is a refinement of Raghavan's results, establish additional properties of the adjoints of the game matrices. 
                                     #theorem:cofactors 
                                         If a bimatrix game is completely mixed and $$v_A=0$$, the cofactors $$A_{i1},\ldots,A_{in}$$ of the matrix $$A$$ are either all zero or all have the same sign, for any $$1\le i\le n$$. If $$v_B=0$$, the same property holds for the cofactors $$B_{1j},\ldots,B_{nj}$$ of the matrix $$B$$, for all $$1\le j\le n$$. 
                                     #proof 
                                         The proof is based on [Raghavan, Theorem 4], using a technique similar to that in the proof for [Kaplanski, Theorem 4].
                                         The result will be proven for $$B$$ and $$v_B$$, the statements for $$A$$ and $$v_A$$ can be done in an analog fashion.
                                             Let $$x$$ be an equilibrium strategy for the second player and assume $$v_{B} = 0$$. Then for $$j\in 1\ldots n$$ one has
                                                 $$\sum_{i=1}^n x_ia_{ij}=0$$.
                                             On the other hand, expanding the determinant using column $$j$$ it holds
                                                 $$0=\det A=\sum_{i=1}^n a_{ij}A_{ij}$$.
                                             Raghavan has shown that a completely mixed bimatrix game with both values zero, the rank of the game matrices is $$n-1$$ and the equilibrium strategy is unique.
                                             Since the equilibrium strategy is unique and $$rank A = n-1$$, these two linear combinations must be unique up to multiplication with a constant. This yields
                                                 $$\frac{x_1}{A_{1j}} = \frac{x_2}{A_{2j}} = \cdots = \frac{x_n}{A_{nj}}$$
                                             So these cofactors have same sign or are all zero.
                                             Then show that sum of adjoints is not zero:
                                                 if it was zero, then $$c_A(\lambda)\equiv 0$$ 
                                                 for a unique completely mixed equilibrium solution $$(x,y)$$ 
                                                 Since $$rk(A)=n-1$$ it follows $$A^*=
                                 For a regular matrix pencil $$A-\lambda E$$, define the __generalised characteristic polynomial__ $$c_A(\lambda):=\det(A-\lambda E)$$. It will be shown to be a polynomial of degree at the most one. 
                                     #lemma:charpoly 
                                         The generalised characteristic polynomial is a linear function $$c_A(\lambda)=c_0-c_1\lambda$$ where $$c_0=\det A$$ and $$c_1=e^t A^*e = \sum_{ij}A_{ij}$$ with $$A_{ij}$$ denoting the cofactor of $$a_{ij}$$.  
                                     This identity has already been used but not proven in @KAPLANSKI. 
                                     A full proof can be found in @KARLIN [A.9], however for convenience to the reader a different and short elementary proof is given here, based on a generalisation to regular matrix pencils of @MILCHTAICH .
                                     #proof 
                                         Consider the square matrix pencil of order $$n+1$$
                                             $$\hat{A}=\begin{pmatrix} A &\lambda e\\- e^t &0\end{pmatrix} $$. 
                                         The determinant of $$\hat{A}$$ can be computed in two different ways. First, use Laplace expansion by the last row to obtain 
                                             $$\det \hat{A} =\sum_{j=1}^n(-1)^{n+j}\det \left( [A]_{j}|\lambda e\right) $$. 
                                         Applying one more Laplace expansion along column $$n$$ in the augmented matrices yields
                                             $$\det \left( [A]_{j}|\lambda e\right)=\sum_{i=1}^n(-1)^{i+n}\det {}_i[A]_{j}\cdot \lambda $$. 
                                         Combining these steps, one has
                                             $$\det \hat{A}= \sum_{i,j=1}^n(-1)^{i+j}\det {}_i[A]_{j}\cdot \lambda =\sum_{i,j} A_{ij}\cdot \lambda      $$. 
                                         On the other hand, rewriting the initial matrix as
                                             $$\hat{A} = \begin{pmatrix} A &0+\lambda e\\-e^t &1-1\end{pmatrix} $$
                                         and applying the linearity of the determinant w.r.t. the last column, it follows
                                             $$\det \hat{A} =\det \begin{pmatrix} A &0\\-e^t &1\end{pmatrix} -\det \begin{pmatrix} A &-\lambda e\\-e^t &1\end{pmatrix} =\det A-\det \begin{pmatrix} A-\lambda E &-\lambda e\\ 0 &1\end{pmatrix} =\det A-\det (A-\lambda E) $$.
                                         The second equality 
                                         Finally combining these results finishes the proof:
                                             $$\det (A-\lambda E) = \det A-\sum_{i,j} A_{ij}\cdot \lambda$$.
                                 Finally, the proof follows directly from Lemma #lemma:cofactors:ref and #lemma:charpoly:ref as the regularity of the pencil and the properties of the generalised eigenvectors are established. 
                             __The conditions are sufficient.__ This follows directly from Theorem #theorem:bimatrix-regular-theorem:ref yielding a completely mixed equlibrium strategy pair from the strictly positive generalised eigenvectors.
                     Related Work #h 
                         In summary, the purely game-theoretical results of this paper show that the use of generalised eigensystems is a natural approach when focussing on completely mixed equilibrium solutions of bimatrix games. 
                         Adapting the work of @THOMPSON to bimatrix games, the line of research initiated by @RAMAGHAN is led to a satisfying next level. Furthermore, some closely related results of @MILCHTAICH can be stated more naturally. The results on the relationship between inactive strategies, generalised eigenvalues and strategic dominance, first given by @WEIL for matrix games, appear to be novel in the bimatrix game setting. 
                         LIMITATIONS
                             At first glance, a limitation of this work appears to be the restriction to square bimatrix games. On the other hand, as shown in [], any non-square bimatrix game has inactive strategies and hence does not have completely mixed equilibrium strategies. 
                             It would be interesting to combine existing methods for solving non-square bimatrix games with the approach of this section and to investigate resulting advantages.

                                 Focusing on the single software asset that contains a vulnerability, we define a __single-target small security game__ in normal form through the following payoff matrix
                                 $$\begin{array}{ | c | c | c | }  \mathcal{D} \downarrow \mathcal{A}\rightarrow & s_a & s_{-{a}} \\ s_d &  - c^{\mathcal{D}}, - c^{\mathcal{A}}&  -c^{\mathcal{D}},  0 \\  s_{-{d}} &  -l^{\mathcal{D}},  l^{\mathcal{D}}- c^{\mathcal{A}} &  0,  0 \end{array}$$  #normal
                                 where the rows correspond to the pure strategies available to the defender $$\mathcal{D}$$ and the columns are the attacker's pure strategies. Here  we assume that the attacker's benefit equals the loss of the defender. 
                                 This game has been studied in the past (see e.g. \cite{@Samarji2015}) and is suitable for our scenario which is based on a single asset vulnerability assessment. It is not the specialisation of a big security game.
                                 The following assumption seem reasonable in a realistic setup:

                             Game Analysis #slide 
                                 The analysis of this presented security game is not difficult, it can be shown that there are no pure Nash equilibrium strategies as [..] and hence a closed-form expression exists \cite{} for determining the values $$p^{*} = \frac{c^{\mathcal{A}}}{l^{\mathcal{D}}} = 1 - \frac{c^{\mathcal{A}}}{l^{\mathcal{D}}}$$ and $$q^{*} = \frac{c^{\mathcal{D}}}{l^{\mathcal{D}}}$$ forming a mixed Nash equilibrium strategy $$(s_D^{*}, s_A^{*})$$ where $$p^*$$ and $$q^*$$ are the probability of defense and attack respectively. 
                                 This will be the underlying method to compute our attack likelihood in this scenario, based on $$q^*$$.
                                 One verifies that the expected utilities in this case are $$ u_D^{*} = -c^{\mathcal{D}} $$ and $$ u_A^{*} = 0 $$.
                                 [TODO: derive these results by applying the algebraic framework from the previous section]
                                 Issues: complete info problematic; attacker needs to know defense cost and loss; defender needs to know attack cost;
                         2. Add CVSS metrics to the utility functions #h
                             Move to CVSS #slide 
                                 We  now use CVSS to specify the payoff functions of the single-target security game of the previous section.  
                                 To achieve this aim, we will use the CVSS impact and exploitability sub-scores. 
                                 Our aim is only use this publicly available scoring data, as we are assuming a complete information game.
                             Approach #slide 
                                 The loss for the defender is due to the attack impact, which will be modelled as a function of the CVSS impact sub-score: $$l^{\mathcal{D}} =f({\mu}_{Imp})$$. 
                                 Furthermore we assume that the defender applies the principle of adequate protection [@pfleeger] by investing an amount for defence that is proportional to the loss: $$c^{\mathcal{D}} \sim f({\mu}_{Imp})$$ where $$f$$ is linear. 
                                 The attack cost depends on the CVSS exploitability subscore, taking into account that high score values indicate a vulnerability that is easy to exploit: $$c^{\mathcal{A}} = g({\mu_{Exp}})$$.
                             CVSS Game #slide 
                                 We start with the following game:
                                 $$\begin{array}{ | c | c | c | } \mathcal{D} \downarrow \mathcal{A}\rightarrow & a& \overline{a} \\ d &?,?& ?, 0 \\ \overline{d} &? ,?& 0, 0 \end{array}$$ #normal
                         3. Find normalised (strategically equivalent) game #h
                             Normalised CVSS Game #slide 
                                 We obtain the following game normal form:
                                 $$\begin{array}{ c | c | c } \mathcal{D} \downarrow \mathcal{A}\rightarrow & a& \overline{a} \\ \hline d & - \mu_{Imp},  {\mu}_{Exp}-10& -\mu_{Imp}, 0 \\ \hline\overline{d} & -{\mu}_{Imp}, {\mu}_{Imp}+10- {\mu}_{Exp} & 0, 0 \end{array}$$
                         4. Solve game and derive metrics #h
                         5. Analyse metrics, compare with existing ones #h
                     Notations and Terminology #slide 
                         Throughout this section we assume that there is a software asset $$s$$ with a vulnerability $$v$$. 
                         We denote by $$S_{\mathcal{D}}=\{d,\overline{d}\}$$ the strategy set of the Defender, where $$d$$ corresponds to the strategy that the Defender patches $$v$$ and $$\overline{d}$$ corresponds to the strategy that the Defender does not patch $$v$$. Likewise, the strategy set of the Attacker is given by $$S_{\mathcal{A}}=\{a,\overline{a}\}$$, where $$a$$ corresponds to the strategy of the Attacker to exploit $$v$$ and $$\overline{a}$$ that the Attacker does not attempt to exploit $$v$$) respectively, e.g. by running some malware. To patch the vulnerability, we assume that there is an associate cost, $$c^{\mathcal{D}}$$ for the Defender. To exploit vulnerability $$v$$, we assume that there is a cost $$c^{\mathcal{A}}$$ for the Attacker and a benefit $$b^{\mathcal{A}}$$. We assume that this benefit matches a loss $$l^{\mathcal{D}} = b^{\mathcal{A}}$$ for the Attacker. % #gamesec
                     CVSS Game
                         Example: Case Study 2 #slide 
                             The analysis of the previous game can be used for the vulnerability patching scenario.
                             The goal is to find realistic values for the game payoff parameters $$l^D$$ and $$c^A$$.
                             This could be done for example using the __Common Vulnerability Scoring System__ (CVSS).
                             Information about the severity of the vulnerability is publicly available online.
                         Case Study 2 (continued) #slide 
                             The attacker's cost $$c^A$$ is proportional to the inverse of the CVSS __exploitability subscore__:
                                 $$c^A = \alpha \cdot {\mu_{E}}^{-1} $$.
                                 Here, $$\alpha$$ is a constant that needs to be suitably defined.
                             The loss of the defender $$l^D$$ is due to a threat event impact, exploiting the vulnerability and affecting the asset's CIA security requirements.
                             Using the CVSS impact subscore, a vector $$V$$ with numerical components is defined, depending on the security criticality of the asset. 
                                 This yields $$l^D =   \mu_{Imp, C} \cdot V_C + \mu_{Imp, I} \cdot V_I + \mu_{Imp, A} \cdot V_A$$.
                             Finally, by plugging this into the game solutions, a recommendation can be made for the decision to patch the vulnerability.

                                 Black hat hackers are criminals who act with malicious intent.
                                 Their motivation is often financial gain or revenge.
                                     They may also release malware that destroys files, holds computers hostage, or steals personal information.
                                     Black hats spread havoc wherever they go, often causing serious damage to individuals and organizations alike.
                                 Sometimes they target people they strongly disagree with for ideological reasons.
                             Slide Title: Gray Hat Hackers
                                 Gray hat hackers engage in a mix of both black and white hat activities.
                                 They may look for system vulnerabilities without permission or knowledge from the owner, and may report any issues found to the owner for a small fee.
                                 Gray hats may sometimes violate laws or ethical standards but usually lack the malicious intent of black hat hackers.
                                 They may believe they are doing good for companies by hacking into their systems, but owners rarely appreciate unauthorized access to their business information infrastructure.
                                 Often, the real intention of gray hats is to showcase their skills and gain publicity and recognition for contributing to cybersecurity.
                             Slide Title: Definition of a White Hat Hacker
                                 A white hat hacker is a computer security expert who specializes in finding vulnerabilities in systems and networks.
                                 Unlike black hat hackers, white hat hackers use their skills for ethical and lawful purposes, such as testing and improving the security of computer systems and networks.
                                 White hat hackers may be hired by organizations to conduct penetration testing or vulnerability assessments to identify potential weaknesses in their systems.
                                 They may also participate in bug bounty programs, where companies offer rewards to hackers who identify and report vulnerabilities in their systems.
                                 White hat hackers may also develop and promote security best practices, and may work with law enforcement or other organizations to help combat cybercrime.
                             __Black hat hacker definition__
                                 __Black hat hackers are criminals who break into computer networks with malicious intent. They may also release malware that destroys files, holds computers hostage, or steals passwords, credit card numbers, and other personal information.__
                                 __Black hats are motivated by self-serving reasons, such as financial gain, revenge, or simply to spread havoc. Sometimes their motivation might be ideological, by targeting people they strongly disagree with.__
                             __White hat hacker definition__
                                 __White hat hackers – sometimes also called “ethical hackers” or “good hackers” – are the antithesis of black hats. They exploit computer systems or networks to identify their security flaws so they can make recommendations for improvement__
                             __Gray hat hacker definition__
                                 __Somewhere between white and black are gray hat hackers. Gray hat hackers enact a blend of both black hat and white hat activities. Gray hat hackers often look for vulnerabilities in a system without the owner's permission or knowledge. If issues are found, they report them to the owner, sometimes requesting a small fee to fix the problem.__
                                 __A grey hat is a computer hacker or computer security expert who may sometimes violate laws or typical ethical standards, but usually does not have the malicious intent typical of a black hat hacker.__
                                 __Some gray hat hackers like to believe they are doing something good for companies by hacking their websites and invading their networks without permission. Still, company owners rarely appreciate unauthorized forays into their business information infrastructure.__
                                 __Often, a gray hat's real intention is to show off their skills and gain publicity — maybe even appreciation — for what they consider a contribution to cybersecurity.__

                                 The following theorem gives a sufficient condition for the existence of an NE of the form (\ref{eq:NE-bimatrix). 
                                 Given the game $$\mathcal{G}(A,B,C)$$, assume the matrix pencils $$A-\lambda C$$  and $$B-\lambda C$$ are both regular, each with a real eigenvalue $$\mu_A$$ and $$\mu_B$$ respectively. Let $$x_{\mu_B}$$ be a nonnegative left eigenvector of $$B-\lambda C$$ with respect to $$\mu_B$$ and denote $$y_{\mu_A}$$ a nonnegative right eigenvector of $$B-\lambda C$$ with respect to $$\mu_A$$. Then $$(x^*,y^*) = (x_{\mu_B}$$, $$y_{\mu_A}$$) is an NE strategy profile of the game $$\mathcal{G}$$ and $$(\mu_A, \mu_B)$$ is the corresponding game value pair.
                             Proof #slide 
                                 We have for a nonnegative left eigenvector $$x_{\mu_B}$$ satisfying $$x^\top_{\mu_B} B = \mu_B x^\top_{\mu_B} C$$ that for any Player 2 strategy $$y$$ it holds $$\frac{x^\top_{\mu_B} B y}{x^\top_{\mu_B} C y} = \mu_B $$. 
                                 This trivially implies $$\frac{x^\top_{\mu_B} B y_{\mu_A}}{x^\top_{\mu_B} C y_{\mu_A}} \ge \frac{x^\top_{\mu_B} B y}{x^\top_{\mu_B} C y} $$. 
                                 Similarly, we can show for a nonnegative right eigenvector $$y_{\mu_A}$$ that $$\frac{x^\top_{\mu_B} Ay_{\mu_A}}{x^\top_{\mu_B} C y_{\mu_A}} \ge \frac{x Ay_{\mu_A}}{x C y_{\mu_A}} $$ for any Player 1 strategy $$x$$.
                                 Hence these strategies are mutual best responses and by definition NE strategies with payoffs $$\mu_A$$ and $$\mu_B$$ as required.  
                                 From this, the theorem follows.

                                 If $$C=E$$, this yields a linear algebra characterisation for NE solutions for standard bimatrix games.
                                 If eigenvectors are positive, we obtain completely mixed solutions

                                 We define normalised left and right eigenvectors w.r.t. the factorisation of $$B$$ as eigenvectors satisfying $$x^\top u = 1$$ and $$y v^\top = 1$$.

                                 Otherwise, the pencil has a single finite eigenvalue $$c=\frac{\det(A)}{v^\top \text{adj}(A) u}$$.
                                 The associated left and right normalised eigenvectors $$x,y$$ can be determined as follows:
                                     $$x^\top=\frac{v^\top\text{adj}(A)}{v^\top \text{adj}(A) u}$$,

                                 It can directly be verified that, based on the definitions of $$c$$, $$x$$ and $$y$$ as in the theorem, that it holds $$Ay=cuv^\top y$$ and $$x^\top A=cx^\top uv^\top$$. 
                                 So $$c$$ is an eigenvalue, and this must be the only one as the degree of the characteristic polynomial $$\det(A-\lambda B)$$ is one. 
                                 Furthermore, it can be seen that $$x^\top$$ and $$y$$ are normalised eigenvectors.

                                 \subsection{Rank-1 Bimatrix Games}
                                 This section considers the case where $$C\ge 0$$, $${\rm rank}(C)=1$$, and the implications on the existence of NE solutions of the game $${\mathcal{G}}(A,B,C)$$.
                                 
                                 We refer to a matrix pencil of the form $$A-\lambda B$$ and $${\rm rank}(C)=1$$ as a rank-1 pencil. We can then use rank-factorisation to write $$C={p}{q}$$ where $${p},{q}\in \mathbb{R}^n$$ are nonnegative row and column vectors.
                                 We define normalised left and right eigenvectors w.r.t. the representation $$C=pq$$ as eigenvectors satisfying $$x {p} = 1$$ and $$y {q} = 1$$.
                                 
                                 The following proposition provides an eigenspace structure result for rank-1 regular matrix pencils, which will be required when analysing the Shades of Grey game in Section \ref{sec:shades-of-grey}.
                                 \begin{proposition}
                                     The rank-1 pencil $$A-\lambda pq$$ has no finite eigenvalues if $${q}\,{\rm adj}(A) {p}=0$$. Otherwise, the pencil has the single finite eigenvalue $$c=\frac{\det(A)}{{q} \,\,{\rm adj}(A) {p}}$$.
                                     The associated left and right normalised eigenvectors $$x,y$$ can be determined explicitly using the formulae $$x=\frac{{q}\,{\rm adj}(A)}{{q} \,{\rm adj}(A) {p}}$$ and $$y=\frac{\,{\rm adj}(A){p}}{{q} \,{\rm adj}(A) {p}}$$.

                                     Based on the definitions of $$c$$, $$x$$ and $$y$$ as in the proposition, it can be directly verified that $$Ay=c{p}{q} y$$ and $$x A=cx {p}{q}$$.
                                     So $$c$$ is a finite eigenvalue of $$A-\lambda pq$$ with left and right eigenvectors $$x$$ and $$y$$. This must be the only eigenvalue as the degree of the characteristic polynomial $$\det(A-\lambda pq)$$ is bound by $${\rm rank}(pq)$$, which is one. Furthermore, it is straightforward to see that $$x$$ and $$y$$ are normalised eigenvectors.
                                 \end{proof}

                                 In this game model, we have $$N=1$$ using the notations of \cite{Shapley1953-hi}. 
                                 Using modern terminology, we would say we have a 2-state Markov-game with a transient state $$s_0$$ ``play" and an absorbing state $$s_1$$ ``stop''. 
                                 State transition probabilities depend on the current state and chosen strategies.

                                 Natural questions to ask are then:
                                     What is the expected number of steps for the game to finish?
                                     How can we define a value and optimal solutions to this repeated zero-sum game?
                                     How it might these relate to the value and optimal solutions of the stage game?
                                 Let us fix a strategy profile $$(x^\top,y)$$.

                                 The following well-known lemma summarises answers:
                                 \begin{lemma}[\cite{Shapley1953-hi}]
                                     The expected number of steps required for the game $$\mathcal{G}(A,S)$$ to stop when using the stationary strategy $$(x^\top,y)$$ is $$1/x^\top Sy$$. The expected resulting payoff  is $$u=\frac{x^\top Ay}{x^\top Sy}.$$ The value $$v$$ of the game is well-defined by
                                     $$ v=\max_x\min_y \frac{x^\top Ay}{x^\top Sy} = \min_y\max_x \frac{x^\top Ay}{x^\top Sy}. $$
                                     In general, $$v$$ is hence different from the value of the stage game.
                                 \end{lemma}

                                 A partial extension is:
                                 \begin{lemma}
                                     Assume the stationary strategy $$(x^\top,y)$$ satisfies $$x^\top Sy<1$$.
                                     Then the expected number of steps required for the game $$\mathcal{G}(A,B,S)$$ to stop when the players are using $$(x^\top,y)$$ is $$1/x^\top Sy$$. The expected resulting payoff is $$u=(\frac{x^\top Ay}{x^\top Sy},\frac{x^\top By}{x^\top Sy}).$$ 
                                 \end{lemma}
                             Proof #slide 
                                 After $$k$$ iterations the accumulated payoff of the game when playing the same strategy $$(x^\top,y)$$ in each round is $$u_{A,k}(x,y)=x^\top Ay\sum_{i=0}^{k-1}(1-x^\top Sy)^i$$ and $$u_{B,k}(x,y)=x^\top By\sum_{i=0}^{k-1}(1-x^\top Sy)^i$$. 
                                 Since $$s:=1-x^\top Sy<1$$, the game finishes with probability one and $$ \sum_{i=0}^\infty s^i = \frac{1}{1-s}$$.
                                 The expected game payoff pair is $$u = (u_{A},u_{B}) = \lim_{k\to \infty}(u_{A,k},u_{B,k})=(\frac{x^\top Ay}{x^\top Sy},\frac{x^\top By}{x^\top Sy})$$.

                                 We would like to maximise $$u$$
                                 This leads to $$ u=(\max_x\max_y \frac{x^\top Ay}{x^\top Sy},\max_y\max_x \frac{x^\top By}{x^\top Sy}).$$
                                 This value might not be specific to $$u$$, and not unique

                                             If Player 1's mixed strategy $$x^*$$ is a best response to the (mixed) strategy $$y$$ of the other player, then, for each pure strategy $$e_i$$ such that $$x_i > 0$$, it must be the case that $$e_i$$ is itself a best response.  In particular, the payoff $$e_i Ay$$ must be the same for all such strategies.
                                         Note: an analogous lemma can be stated for Player 2, $$y^*$$ and $$x$$.
                                     Proof (I) #slide #CYENS 
                                         Recap: due to $$x^* \in \mathcal{BR}(y^*)$$ we have $${}^t \!x^*Ay^*=v_{A}$$ and $${}^t \!xAy^*\le v_{A}$$ for all $$x$$. 
                                         Let us write $${}^t \!x^*= (x^*_{1},\ldots ,x^*_{i},\ldots ,x^*_{n})$$ and assume $$x^*_{i}\neq 0$$.
                                         Furthermore, denote $${}^t \!e_{i}= (\underbrace{0,\ldots ,0}_{i-1}, 1, 0,\ldots , 0)$$.
                                         It is clear that $${}^t \!e_{i}Ay^*\le v_{A}$$ (why?).
                                     Proof (II) #slide #CYENS 
                                         Now assume $${}^t \!e_{i}Ay^*< v_{A}$$, minimal for all pure strategies. 
                                         Find $$j\neq i$$, $$x_{j}^*\neq 0$$ (such $$j$$ exists since $$x^*$$ is not pure) and define ("falling from the sky"):
                                             $${}^t \!\hat{x}={}^t \!x^*-x_i^* {\;}^t\! e_i+x_i^* {\;}^t\! e_j$$.
                                         It follows
                                             $$^t\!\hat{x}Ay^*={}^t\!x^*Ay^*+x_{i}^*\overbrace{(^t\!e_{j}Ay^*-{}^t\!e_{i}Ay^*)}^{>0}>\,{}^t\! x^*Ay^*$$
                                         which is a contradiction. Hence we must have $${}^t \!e_{i}Ay^*= v_{A}$$. 
                                         An additional consequence is $${}^t \!x^*Ay^*= v_{A}{}^t\!e$$.

                                             The rank-2 Black or White game has precisely one Pareto-optimal Nash equilibrium $$(x^*,y^*)$$ with associated game value profile $$(v^*_D,v^*_G)$$. Depending on the comparative relationship between $$b_a$$ and $$b_f$$, it holds:
                                                 If $$b_a \le b_f$$, then the equilibrium is pure with $${}^tx^*=(0,1),y^*=\begin{pmatrix}  0\\1  \\ \end{pmatrix}$$ and $$v^*_D=b_p-c_f,v^*_G=b_f$$.
                                                 If $$b_a > b_f$$, then there is an equilibrium with one mixed and one pure strategy: $${}^tx^*=\begin{pmatrix}  \frac{b_a-b_f}{2b_a-c_r},&\frac{b_a+b_f-c_r}{2b_a-c_r}  \\ \end{pmatrix},y^*=\begin{pmatrix}  0\\1  \\ \end{pmatrix}$$ and $$v^*_D=b_p-c_f,v^*_G=b_a$$.

             GT+Matrix
                 One of the early works which was a source of inspiration for this present paper is @KAPLANSKI. In his article, the value $$v$$ of a zero-sum game is determined from its coefficient matrix, although the algorithm is not efficient. The uniqueness property of completely mixed solutions is established and their presence detected based on necessary and sufficient conditions involving order, rank and adjoint properties of the game matrix $$A$$, after reducing $$v$$ to zero using a substitution.
                 Theorem #theorem:bimatrix-mixed:ref of this paper, when specialised to matrix games, generalises Kaplanski's result as the  necessary and sufficient conditions stated in the theorem are valid for any value $$v$$. 
                 @WEIL #wfe-ignore-item 
                 In a series of papers ( @THOMPSON-a, @THOMPSON-b) work on the relationship between matrix games and generalised eigensystems, later extended to a more general problem (the Von Neumann economic model) in @THOMPSON-c, was undertaken. 
                 These results failed to achieve great  attention in the wider game theory research community apart from the niche specialist area due to their "lack of parsimony" (as quoted from @THOMPSON-a) and inability of leading to significant algorithmic improvements. 
                 One of the game theoretical insights gained in this paper is the fact that for restricted types of equilibrium solutions --- that of completely mixed ones --- the view of equilibrium solutions as solutions of associated generalised eigensystems is in fact very natural and useful, as will be demonstrated in the application section of this paper.
                 More recently, @RAGHAVAN revisits @KAPLANSKI and initiates an extension to bimatrix games. 
                 In his work, Raghavan shows that important properties of completely mixed solutions known for matrix games also are valid for bimatrix games. His main result is that completely mixed equilibrium strategies are unique and require the game matrices to be square. 
                 However Theorem xxx is not stated for bimatrix games. A necessary condition is given, on the other hand, the result is not constructive, as supportive of Theorem 4 in \cite{} requires the knowledge of the game's value pair.
                 His work does not use the notion of generalised eigensystems. 
                 In two consecutive papers ( @MILCHTAICH2006, @MILCHTAICH200x ), the authors present work which is closely related to the results of this section, although they do not use the language of generalised eigensystems. In the first paper, a formula is developed for determining an equilibrium value of a bimatrix game if the support of the corresponding solution is known in advance. This is extended in the second paper where necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of completely mixed solutions are given, and an explicit solution formula is constructed for this case. 
                 Using the linear algebra concepts of this paper, their results can be viewed as stating necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of non-negative (strictly positive in the completely mixed case) left and right generalised eigenvectors of the game matrices, with respect to real generalised eigenvalues, as well as the explicit construction of these. Their solution formula, necessary and sufficient conditions for completely mixed solutions are algebraically equivalent to the ones developed in this paper.

                     The Human-in-the-Loop Principle #slide 
                         Definition: Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) is a design pattern that integrates human expertise into the automated process of a system.
                         Explanation: This means that humans are involved in the loop of a system to make critical decisions, improve the system's performance, and ensure accountability.
                         Benefits: HITL systems are more flexible, adaptable, and can handle edge cases better than purely automated systems. They can improve the accuracy and efficiency of the system, while also providing a means of accountability for actions taken.
                         Example: HITL is often used in cybersecurity, where automated systems are combined with human expertise to detect and respond to security threats. For example, security analysts can be alerted to potential attacks and then investigate to determine the validity of the threat and decide on the appropriate response.
                         Challenges: Implementing HITL systems can be challenging because it requires the integration of human expertise with automated processes. It also requires proper training, clear communication, and well-defined roles and responsibilities to ensure that the human-in-the-loop system functions effectively.

                         Tremendous amounts of oil and gas products are transported in pipelines worldwide resulting in increasing interest to identify the hazards and evaluate the associated risks associated with this critical infrastructure. Third-party intrusion is one of the least quantifiable factors being considered during the pipeline hazard assessment stage despite the substantial contributing to the total number of oil and gas pipeline incidents. This is because a probabilistic risk assessment cannot reliably model human actions and be applied to intentional acts. Due to the distinctive motivations of third-party damage, an unintentional third-party damage Bayesian Network model and a game-theoretic model on malicious intrusion will therefore be built, to examine the mechanism of pipeline failure caused by this mode. This study is conducted aiming at investigating pipeline risk resulting from third-party damage, and will formulate risk assessment models to identify threats, prioritize risks and determine which integrity plan should apply to different pipeline segments given the condition of third-party interference (both the accidental damage and malicious acts).

                                 Columns are the attacker's strategies.

                         Game Analysis Summary #slide
                             In order to slightly simplify the game, we assume "the winner gets it all": $$G = I$$
                             **Theorem 1**. The security game $$\mathcal{G}(\mathcal{D},\mathcal{A})$$ has no pure Nash Equilibrium. A mixed Nash Equilibrium strategy pair $$(x_\mathcal{D}^∗,y_\mathcal{A}^∗)$$ is obtained, where $$x_\mathcal{D}^∗=1-c_\mathcal{A}/G$$ and $$y_\mathcal{A}^∗=c_\mathcal{D}/I$$ are the probability of defense and attack respectively. The resulting expected payoffs, in this case, are $$u_\mathcal{D}^∗=−c_\mathcal{D}$$ and $$u_\mathcal{A}^∗=0$$.
                             **Proof**: The proof of this theorem will be obtained as a special case for that of Theorem 2.
                         Discussion #slide 
                             Main problem: $$u_\mathcal{A}^∗=0$$.
                                 Would this be desirable for attacker?
                                 GT needs to be accepted by all real-world players.
                             Solution: reward scheme.
                                 If outcomes of security assessment match observed reality, there will be a reward $$r_{\mathcal{D}}$$ for the defender
                                 Otherwise, the attacker will benefit from a reward $$r_{\mathcal{A}}$$.

                                 there are three categories of games
                             Depending on the value of $$r_{\mathcal{D}}$$, there could be no, one or two pure NEs.
                             In the latter case, there will also be one mixed NE equilibrium.

                         Equations for Generic Generalised Eigensystem #slide 
                             For a generic matrix $$A$$, the components of a generalised eigensystem $$\mathcal{E}_A=\left(\mu, x^t, y\right)$$ are determined as follows:
                                 The eigenvalue is the real number $$\mu = {{a_{1}\,a_{4}-a_{2}\,a_{3}}\over{a_{1}+a_{4}-a_{2}-a_{3}}}$$, assuming that the denominator in this expression does not vanish. 
                                 The corresponding left eigenvector  is $$x^t=\left(a_{3}-a_{1}\right)\,\begin{pmatrix}a_{4}-a_{3}&a_{1}-a_{2}\end{pmatrix}$$ and $$y=\left(a_{1}-a_{2}\right)\begin{pmatrix}a_{2}-a_{4}\cr a_{3}-a_{1}\end{pmatrix}$$ is the right eigenvector.

                             For a bimatrix game $$G(A,B)$$, the following aggregated generalised eigensystem is of interest: $$\mathcal{E}_{A,B} = \left(\mu_A, y_A,\mu_B, x_B^t\right)$$
                             We have
                                 $$\mu_A = {{a_{1}\,a_{4}-a_{2}\,a_{3}}\over{a_{1}+a_{4}-a_{2}-a_{3}}}$$
                                 $$y_A=\left(a_{1}-a_{2}\right)\begin{pmatrix}a_{2}-a_{4}\cr a_{3}-a_{1}\end{pmatrix}$$
                                 $$\mu_B = {{b_{1}\,b_{4}-b_{2}\,b_{3}}\over{b_{1}+b_{4}-b_{2}-b_{3}}}$$
                                 $$x_B^t=\left(b_{1}-b_{3}\right)\,\begin{pmatrix}b_{3}-b_{4}&b_{2}-b_{1}\end{pmatrix}$$
                         Fundamental Theorem #slide 
                             Specialising the work of (Thompson et al) to matrix games, we extend their main fundamental theorem to bimatrix games as follows: 
                             Given a square bimatrix game $$G(A,B)$$, assume the matrix pencils $$A-\lambda E$$  and $$B-\lambda E$$ are both regular, each with a real eigenvalue $$\mu_A$$ and $$\mu_B$$ respectively. Let $$x_{\mu_B}$$ be a nonnegative left eigenvector of $$B-\lambda E$$ with respect to $$\mu_B$$ and denote $$y_{\mu_A}$$ a nonnegative right eigenvector of $$A-\lambda E$$ with respect to $$\mu_A$$. Then $$(x^*,y^*) = (x_{\mu_B}$$, $$y_{\mu_A}$$) is a Nash Equilibrium strategy profile of the game $$G$$ and $$(\mu_A, \mu_B)$$ is the corresponding game value pair. #eyo-style:Theorem  #theorem:bimatrix-regular-theorem 
                         A Best Response Lemma #slide 
                             The proof of the theorem will be aided by the following lemma. 
                             It exhibits a special case arising where there exists a strategy of one player to which any strategy of the other player is a best response.
                             Following the notations as in the theorem, we have for a nonnegative left generalised eigenvector $$x_{\mu_B}$$ that for all Player 2 strategies $$y$$ it holds $$x^\top_{\mu_B} B y = \mu_B $$. Similarly, a nonnegative right eigenvector $$y_{\mu_A}$$ satisfies $$x^\top A y_{\mu_A} = \mu_A$$ for all Player 1 strategies $$x$$. #eyo-style:Lemma  #lemma:best-response-eigen
                         Case 1 #slide 
                             The non-existence of a pure NE leads to the following conditions, up to permution: $$a_1>a_3$$, $$a_4>a_2$$, $$b_2>b_1$$ and $$b_3>b_4$$.
                             We deduce that both eigenvalues $$\mu_A$$ and $$\mu_B$$ are well defined. 
                             The vectors $$x_B^t$$ and $$y_A$$ are non-zero. 
                             Furthermore each vector has entries having the same sign. 
                                 Define $$\text{sign}(v)$$ as the sign of #wfe-ignore-item 
                             Apply Theorem #theorem:bimatrix-regular-theorem to obtain the unique mixed NE solution pair. 
                         Case 2 #slide 
                             With two pure NEs one obtains $$a_1>a_3$$, $$a_4>a_2$$, $$b_1>b_2$$ and $$b_4>b_3$$.
                             As in Case 1, both vectors are non-zero and all entries have the same sign. 
                             Same approach to obtain the unique mixed NE solution pair by applying Theorem #theorem:bimatrix-regular-theorem . 
                         Case 3 #slide 
                             In this case, a single pure NE implies either 
                             Case (i): $$a_1>a_3$$, $$a_4>a_2$$, $$b_1>b_2$$ and $$b_3>b_4$$; or
                             Case (ii): $$a_1>a_3$$, $$a_2>a_4$$, $$b_1>b_2$$ and $$b_3>b_4$$.
                             There is dominance
                                 In both case (i) and (ii): column 2 of $$B$$ is dominated by column 1
                                 In the case of (ii): row 2 of $$A$$ is also dominated by row 1
                             The game is trivial for at least one of the players.
                             Algebraic property: empty generalised eigensystem.
                             This implies $$\det(A-\lambda E)\equiv c\neq 0$$ or the existence of not nonnegative eigenvectors.

                                     For this, we establish $$\alpha_1>\alpha_5$$ and the chain of unequalities $$\alpha_1>\alpha_3>\alpha_7$$.
                                     Proving $$\alpha_1>\alpha_5$$:

                                     If $$\beta_1>\beta_2$$, the game admits a Pooling BNE $$(\bar{T}\bar{T},\bar{C})$$. 
                                     If $$\beta_4>\beta_3$$, there is a Pooling BNE $$(TT,C)$$.

                                 An entity $$\mathcal U$$ wants to transmit a secret message to a friend. 
                                 The entity $$\mathcal U$$ decides to transmit the secret message $$m$$ as an email through a home internet connection
                                 However, $$\mathcal U$$ is in an environment where all email and internet communications are monitored by the intelligence agencies and the government, they are not to be trusted
                                 The current security techniques used for e-mail security are complicated
                                 PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) and GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) can used but in practice, the setup can be complicated and confusing.
                             Motivation for Security Game Model #slide 
                                 Furthermore, $$\mathcal U$$ decides to apply a game theoritcal approach to formalize decision making processess and predict the adversary behaviour
                                 $$\mathcal U$$ aims to implement an afforable and simple steganographic technique with hope that the secret message will be transmitted securly
                                 The simple stego game presented in this section adopts formost a more defense oriented perspective and focus more on defense rather than the adversary strategies.

Then the generalised eigenvalue and the value of the game coincide: $$v(A)=\mu$$. Furthermore, $$x_\mu$$ and $$y_\mu$$ are optimal solutions of the game with maximal support. #novel 
                                 Assume the matrix pencil $$A-\lambda E$$ is regular, with a real eigenvalue $$\mu$$ corresponding to nonnegative left and right normalised eigenvectors $$x_\mu$$ and $$y_\mu$$. Then the value of the game $$G(A)$$ is $$v(A)=\mu$$ and $$(x_\mu$$, $$y_\mu$$) is an optimal strategy profile.  #novel

                             We have $$v\le x^* Ay_\mu=\mu ex^*=\mu$$ for any optimal solution $$x^*$$. Furthermore it also holds $$v\ge x_\mu Ay^*=\mu ^\top\! ey^*=\mu$$ for any optimal solution $$y^*$$.
                             From this we obtain $$v=\mu$$ and $$x_\mu Ay_\mu=\mu$$ from which the theorem follows.

                                 Assume the matrix pencil $$A-\lambda E$$ is regular, with a real eigenvalue $$\mu$$. Then the following holds:
                                     There is an associated generalised nonnegative left eigenvector $$x_\mu ^t\Longrightarrow \underline{v} \ge \mu$$. 
                                     There is an associated generalised nonnegative right eigenvector $$y_\mu \Longrightarrow  \overline{v} \le \mu$$.
                                 In particular, if both generalised eigenvectors are nonnegative, $$v=\mu$$.

                                 We have $$\underline{v} = \min_y \max_x xAy \ge \min_y \mu e^\top y = \mu$$ by choosing $$x=x_\mu$$ to derive the lower estimate of the maximum. 
                                 On the other hand, $$\overline{v}=\max_x \min_y xAy \le \max_x \mu xe = \mu$$.

                                     On the other hand, we can swap rows and columns block-wise while preserving the determinant of the block-matrix, and apply the same identity to the top left block of
                                         $$\tilde{M}=\begin{pmatrix}  \beta A & \alpha L  \\ R^\top & I_r\\   \end{pmatrix}$$.
                                     Collecting powers of $$\beta$$, this yields
                                         $$\det(\tilde{M})=\beta^{n-r}\det(A)\det(\beta I_r-\alpha R^\top A^{-1}L)$$.
                                     This proves the lemma.

                         The complete set of eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of a regular matrix pencil $$A-\lambda B$$ can be determined as follows:
                             Assume $$B=LR^\top$$ is a full rank factorisation. 
                             Let $$k\in\R$$ such that $$A+kB$$ is invertible. 
                             Define the matrix $$C=R^\top (A+kB)^{-1}L$$. 
                         The eigensystem can then be derived from that of $$C$$:
                             The finite, nonzero eigenvalues of $$C$$ can be mapped into the finite eigenvalues of $$A-\lambda B$$,
                             The matrix eigenvalue zero corresponds to the infinite eigenvalue of the pencil.
                     Summarising Theorem #slide  #novel 
                         If $$B=LR^\top$$ is a full-rank factorisation and $$k\in \R$$ such that $$A+kB$$ is nonsingular, there is a one-to-one correspondence between eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $$A-\lambda B$$ and those of $$C=R^\top (A+kB)^{-1}L$$. For each right eigenvector $$y_\mu$$ of $$C$$ associated with an eigenvalue $$\mu$$ (left eigenvector $$x^\top_\mu$$ respectively), if $$A^{-1}Ly_\mu\neq 0$$, this vector is a right eigenvector (the vector $$x^\top_\mu R^\top A^{-1}\neq 0$$ is a left eigenvector respectively) of $$P(\lambda)$$ with finite eigenvalue $$\lambda=\mu^{-1}-k$$ if $$\mu\neq 0$$, and the infinite eigenvalue otherwise. #theorem
                     On Rank-1 Regular Matrix Pencils #h
                         Introduction #slide 
                             Consider a regular matrix pencil of the form $$A-\lambda B$$ where $$\text{rank}(B)=1$$. 
                             We call this a __rank-1 pencil__. 
                             We can write $$B=uv^\top$$ where $$u,v\in {\R_{\neq 0}}^n$$. 
                             Note that then $$\text{rank}(A) \ge n-1$$ (as otherwise $$\text{rank}(A-\mu B) < n-1+1 =n$$ for all $$\mu \in \R$$ and the pencil would not be regular).
                         Remarks #slide 
                             It is clear that the pencil has an eigenvalue at infinity with algebraic multiplicity $$m_\infty=n-1$$. 
                             The corresponding left and right eigenvectors are the elements of $$\text{ker}(B^\top)$$ and $$\text{ker}(B)$$.
                             Now the goal is to find the structure of the finite eigenspaces.
                         Eigenspace Structure Result #slide 
                             We define normalised left and right eigenvectors w.r.t. the factorisation of $$B$$ as eigenvectors satisfying $$x^\top u = 1$$ and $$y v^\top = 1$$. 
                             Structure theorem for finite eigenspace of rank-1 regular pencil:  #novel:theorem
                                 If $$v^\top \text{adj}(A) u=0$$, the pencil has no finite eigenvalues. 
                                 Otherwise, the pencil has a single finite eigenvalue $$c=\frac{\det(A)}{v^\top \text{adj}(A) u}$$.
                                 The associated left and right normalised eigenvectors $$x,y$$ can be determined as follows:
                                     $$x^\top=\frac{v^\top\text{adj}(A)}{v^\top \text{adj}(A) u}$$,
                                     $$y=\frac{\text{adj}(A)u}{v^\top \text{adj}(A) u}$$.
                         Proof of Theorem #slide #proof
                             It can directly be verified that, based on the definitions of $$c$$, $$x$$ and $$y$$ as in the theorem, that it holds $$Ay=cuv^\top y$$ and $$x^\top A=cx^\top uv^\top$$. 
                             So $$c$$ is an eigenvalue, and this must be the only one as the degree of the characteristic polynomial is one. 
                             Furthermore, it can be seen that $$x^\top$$ and $$y$$ are normalised eigenvectors.
                         Some Matrix-Adjoint Identities #slide #novel:proposition 
                             The previous results allow proving the following identities:
                             #proposition For $$a\in \R$$, the following holds:
                                 $$\det(A+a uv^\top)=\det(A)+ av^\top\text{adj}(A)u$$
                                 $$v^\top \;\text{adj}(A+a uv^\top)=v^\top\;\text{adj}(A)$$
                                 $$\text{adj}(A+a uv^\top)u=\text{adj}(A)u$$
                         Proof of Identities #slide 
                             Note that if $$v^\top\;\text{adj}(A)u= 0$$, it follows $$\det(A+a uv^\top)=\det(A)$$ and hence the identities are trivially fulfilled in this case.
                             Otherwise:
                                 It must hold $$\det(A+\lambda uv^\top)=b\lambda +\det(A)$$. 
                                 This is the characteristic polynomial. 
                                 Then we can solve for $$\lambda = -\frac{\det(A)}{b}$$. 
                                 Since $$-\lambda$$ is an eigenvalue, the previous theorem yields $$b=v^\top \text{adj}(A) u$$.
                             The other identities are immediate consequences of the fact that $$A-\lambda uv^\top$$ and $$(A+a uv^\top)-\lambda uv^\top$$ have the same eigenvectors for all real numbers $$a$$.
                         Remarks #slide 
                             The first identity is also known as __matrix determinant lemma__ in the literature \cite{}. 
                             The three identities generalise Karlin's well-known identities for computing optimal solutions of matrix games.
                             This is a pencil with $$B=E$$.
                     Irreducible Pencil #slide 
                         #proposition If the pencil is irreducible, the formulae as in Proposition \ref{} still apply.  
                         Proof
                             Being irreducible, the pencil is similar to either $$I-\lambda N$$ or $$J-\lambda I$$ where $$N$$ is a single nilpotent Jordan block and $$J$$ a single Jordan block with eigenvalue $$\mu\in\R$$. 
                             The case that needs examining is if $$A$$ singular, which corresponds to the latter with $$\mu=0$$. 
                             But then $$\text{rank}(A)=n-1$$, and there exist $$\tilde{u},\tilde{v}\in\R^n$$ such that $$\text{adj}(A)=\tilde{u}\tilde{v}^\top$$. 
                             Then $$x^\top=\tilde{v}^\top L$$, $$y=R\tilde{u}$$.

                             The substitution $$\lambda \leftarrow \lambda+a$$ where $$a\in \R$$ adds $$a$$ to all finite eigenvalues and leaves their eigenvectors invariant. Without loss of generality, it can thus be assumed that $$\det(A)=f(0)=a\neq 0$$ and that $$A$$ be invertible. 
                             If the matrix $$A$$ is singular the previous results still hold subject to a rank condition.

                         GENERAL PROPERTIES OF EVENTUALLY NONNEGATIVE MATRICES
                             Zaslavsky, McDonald, and Tam [31], [32] studied the Jordan form of eventuallynonnegative matrices. 
                             Carnochan Naqvi and McDonald [5] studied combinatorialproperties of eventually nonnegative matrices whose index is 0 or 1 by consideringtheir Frobenius normal forms. 
                         DOMINANT EV
                             Friedland [8] showed that for eventually nonnegative matrices the spectral radius is an eigenvalue. 
                                 Such an eigenvalue and any other eigenvalue whose modulus is equalto the spectral radius is called adominanteigenvalue. Furthermore, if a matrix hasonly one dominant eigenvalue (regardless of its multiplicity), then we call such aneigenvaluestrictly dominant.
                                 Eschenbach and Johnson [7] studied sign patterns of a matrix requiring the spectral radius to be an eigenvalue. They called such a propertythePerron property. 
                             We mention in passing the work of Rump [23], [24], who generalized the conceptof a positive dominant eigenvalue, but this is not related to the questions addressedin this paper.
                         EARLIER
                             Other earlier papers looking at issues relating to the spectralradius being an eigenvalue, at positive or nonnegative corresponding eigenvector, orat matrices with these properties,
                                  include [11], [12], [13], [16], [17], [19], [26], [27], [29].
                         EXTENDED PERRON PROPERTIES 
                             Different nomenclature for different “Perron properties” appear in the literature.In [7], as we already mentioned, thePerron propertystands for having the spectralradius as an eigenvalue, whereas, in [11] theweak Perron propertystands for havingthe spectral radius as a simple positive and strictly dominant eigenvalue. 
                             In [19],thePerron-Frobenius  propertystands for having the spectral radius as a positiveeigenvalue with a nonnegative eigenvector; this is also the definition used in [6].
                              Onthe other hand, in this paper we say that a real matrixApossesses thePerron-Frobenius propertyifρ(A) (whether it is zero or positive) is an eigenvalue ofAhavinga nonnegative eigenvector (which is the same as the definition introduced in [29]).
                                 Moreover, we say thatApossesses thestrong Perron-Frobenius propertyifAhas asimple, positive, and strictly dominant eigenvalue with a positive eigenvector (whichis the same as the definition introduced in [19]).

                         For a regular matrix pencil $$A-\lambda B$$ with a rank-factorisation $$B=LR^\top$$ we define the $$r\times r$$ matrix $$\Lambda:=R^\top \text{adj}(A)L$$. #definition

                         The $$\Lambda$$-matrices obtained from different rank-factorisations of the same matrix $$B$$ are related to each other through application of suitable similarity transformations. 
                         Proof.
                         If $$B=L_1 R_1^\top =L_2 R_2^\top$$, then $$\Lambda_1\sim \Lambda_2$$.

                         If $$[A^{-1}?],L, R > 0$$ and $$\Lambda$$ has the strong PF property, then the regular matrix pencil $$A-\lambda LR^\top$$ has the strong PF property. 
                         If $$A,L_R^{-1}, R_R^{-1} > 0$$ and the regular matrix pencil $$A-\lambda LR^\top$$ has the strong PF property, then $$\Lambda$$ has the strong PF property.
                         If $$A,L,R>0$$ are inverse positive, then: the pencil has the strong PF property iff $$\Lambda$$ has the strong PF property. 
                             #theorem 
                     Proof of Theorem #slide 
                         Due to the definition of the $$\Lambda$$-matrix, we have
                             $$R^\top \text{adj}(A)L\cdot\Lambda=\det(R\top \text{adj}(A)L)\cdot I_r$$ #label:Lambda
                         We will denote $$\mu := \det(R^\top \text{adj}(A)L)$$ for ease of notation.
                         Let $$y>0$$ such that $$\Lambda y=\lambda y$$. We will assert that from this, we can derive a positive eigenvector for the pencil #label:the-pencil, for a suitable eigenvalue.
                          Define $$\tilde{y}= \text{adj}(A)Ly$$. Then we obtain
                             $$A \tilde{y}=A\; \text{adj}(A)Ly=\det(A)Ly$$. 
                         Furthermore, using #label:Lambda 
                             $$\mu y=R^\top \text{adj}(A)L\cdot \Lambda y=R^\top \text{adj}(A)L\cdot \lambda y$$.
                         Hence, putting this together, 
                             $$\mu A \tilde{y}=\det(A)LR^\top \text{adj}(A)L\cdot \lambda y=\det(A)\lambda B\tilde{y}\Longleftrightarrow (\mu A-\det(A)\lambda B)\tilde{y}=0$$.
                         We now distinguish three cases:
                             (i) Case $$\mu\neq 0, \det(A) \neq 0$$:
                                 We can see that $$\frac{\det(A)\lambda}{\mu}$$ is a finite nonzero eigenvalue, with positive eigenvector $$\tilde{y}$$.
                             (ii) Case $$\mu = 0, \det(A) \neq 0$$:
                                 In this case, we can see that $$\tilde{y}$$ is a positive eigenvector for an infinite eigenvalue. 
                             (iii) Case $$\mu \neq 0, \det(A) = 0$$:
                                 Consider $$a \neq 0$$ chosen so that $$\det(A + aLR^\top) \neq 0$$. 
                                 [..]
                                 This can be treated by Case (i) for the pencil $$A+ aLR^\top-\lambda LR^\top$$.
                                 Finally, we obtain that $$\tilde{y}$$ is a positive eigenvector for the eigenvalue $$0$$.
                             (iv) Case $$\mu = 0, \det(A) = 0$$:

                         The probabilistic algorithm for secret matrix share size reduction by \cite{Pfluegel2013-as}:
                             Inspired by previous matrix-based work, but avoid Jordan normal form
                             Propose a probabilistic algorithm, based on using companion form
                             We achieve similarly short shares as Yang and Zhao, but are more efficient
                             This yields a probabilistic online secret sharing scheme with small expected share size
                     Linear Algebra Concepts #slide 
                         Let us review some linear algebra concepts that will be used in the sequel.
                         Let $$A \in \mathbbm{F}_p^{t \times t}$$. The matrix $$A$$ is \emph{cyclic} iff it is similar to matrix in {\em companion form}
                             $$C =\left(\begin{array}{ccccc}0 & 1 & 0 & \ldots & 0 \\0 & 0 & 1 & \ddots & \vdots \\\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \ddots & 0 \\0 & 0 & \ldots & 0 & 1 \\c_{0} & c_{1} & \ldots & c_{t-2} & c_{t-1} \\\end{array}\right)$$.
                         Here, we have that
                             $$f (\lambda) = \lambda^{t} - c_{t-1} \lambda^{t-1} - \cdots- c_{1} \lambda - c_{0}$$
                         is the characteristic polynomial of $$C$$. 
                         For a cyclic matrix, we have that 
                             $$f(\lambda) = \det(C- \lambda I) = \det(A- \lambda I) = m(\lambda)$$ 
                         where $$m(\lambda)$$ is the minimal polynomial of $$A$$.
                     Cyclic Vectors and a Probability Result #slide 
                         If $$A$$ is cyclic, we can use standard linear algebra techniques  to compute $$C$$
                         Algorithm Cyclic\_Vector($$A$$)
                             [(1)] $$v_0:=$$ random vector
                             [(2)] {\bf for} $$i=1$$ {\bf to} $$t-1$$: compute $$v_i:=v_{i-1}A$$
                             [(3)] {\bf if} $$v_0, \ldots, v_{t-1}$$ are linearly independent {\bf then return} \emph{$$v_0$$} {\bf else return} {\em FAIL}
                     Research Question #slide 
                         Question: given a secret $$s$$, and a randomly chosen prime number $$p$$, we can convert $$s$$ to a matrix. How likely is this to induce a random cyclic matrix?
                         \begin{proposition}[Neumann et al., 1994]
                         If a matrix $$A$$ and a vector $$v$$ are chosen at random, then the probability that $$A$$ is cyclic and $$v$$ is a cyclic vector for $$A$$ is $$(1-p^{-1})(1-p^{-2})\cdots(1-p^{-t}) $$ .
                         \end{proposition}
                     Matrix Share Size Reduction Algorithm #slide 
                         This probabilistic algorithm splits secret $$s$$ into public part $$P$$ and (short) secret part $$Q$$
                         We use repeated matrix conversion, with increasing prime numbers
                         Algorithm MSSR($$s$$)
                             [(1)] $$p:=2$$
                             [(2)] /* Conversion of secret */
                                 [(a)] $$p:=$$ next\_prime$$(p)$$
                                 [(b)] Compute the base-$$p$$ digits of $$s$$
                                 [(c)] Convert secret $$s$$ into a $$t \times t$$ matrix $$S$$ by using these digits (padding with 0 if necessary)
                             [(3)] /* Size reduction step */
                                 [(a)] Attempt to compute cyclic vector $$v$$
                                 [(b)] If not successful, go to Step (2)
                                 [(c)] Construct similarity transformation $$T$$ such that $$C := T^{-1}S T$$ is a companion matrix
                             [(4)] Put $$P := T$$ and $$Q := [c_0, c_1, \ldots, c_{t-1}, p]$$
                     An Online Secret Sharing Scheme #slide 
                         We use the MSSR algorithm for an online secret sharing scheme with public and secret data
                         {Share creation}:
                             Compute $$P$$ and $$Q$$ using MSSR algorithm
                             Publish $$P$$
                             Share $$Q$$, using any space efficient secret sharing scheme
                         {Reconstruction of secret}:
                             Reconstruct the characteristic polynomial $$f$$ and the value of $$p$$ by acquiring at least $$k$$ shares
                             Build $$C$$ from the $$t$$ coefficients of $$f$$
                             Compute $$S$$ from $$C$$, by using the public transformation $$T$$ as $$S = T C T ^{-1}$$
                             Reconstruct $$s$$ from $$S$$ and $$p$$

This raises new challenges for quality control and requires an in-depth understanding of how workers' characteristics relate to the quality of their work. In this paper, we use behavioral observations (HIT completion time, fraction of useful labels, label accuracy) to define five worker types: Spammer, Sloppy, Incompetent, Competent, Diligent. Using data collected from workers engaged in the crowdsourced evaluation of the INEX 2010 Book Track Prove It task, we relate the worker types to label accuracy and personality trait information along the 'Big Five' personality dimensions. We expect that these new insights about the types of crowd workers and the quality of their work will inform how to design HITs to attract the best workers to a task and explain why certain HIT designs are more effective than others. {\textcopyright} 2011 ACM.},

                 Description of Research Theme #slide 
                     A number of papers have been published in the area of incomplete information game theoretic approaches for modelling wireless sensor network and client-server architecture scenarios.
                     Types of games considered: mostly dynamic Bayesian (Signalling)
                     Main idea: model different "types" of sensors and their interaction with the receiver $$R$$
                     Precise nature of the types varies, but typically there tend to be 2 types considered in the literature  
                 System Model -- Examples #slide 
                     Cloud service provider, WSN node
                         Faults = attempts to save resources (selfish provider)
                         Vulnerabilities = system breaches by external or internal attackers
                     IDS Node 
                         Faults = deviation from true system state due to miscategorisation of patterns (false positives, true negatives)
                         Vulnerabilities = deliberate deception by attacker who has taken over the node
                 Informal Sensor Types #slide 
                     Cooperative honest sensor
                         Sends accurate results
                         Will also fulfil security requirements
                         less interesting in non-cooperative game theory context
                     Selfish sensor
                         this sensor is non-cooperative
                         tries to save resources, leading to lower quality results/service degradation
                         could be interpreted as (malicious) Byzantine fault
                     Malicious sensor
                         Non-cooperative sensor, interested in personal reward
                         will launch typical attacks (modification, interruption)
                         the entire sensor could be taken over by attacker, or the communication channel could be attacked

                     **Players**: 
                         $$S$$: Sender (Sensor)
                         $$A$$: Attacker
                         $$R$$: Receiver (Monitor, IDS) 
                     **Types**:
                         $$\theta=0$$: cooperative: honest and reliable (secure and dependable system)
                         $$\theta=1$$: unreliable/faulty ("lazy") sender (presence of internal Byzantine fault)
                         $$\theta=2$$: Malicious/uncooperative/not secure/vulnerable (compromised/externally attacked or internal attacker)
                     **Strategy Space**:
                         First Move: $$S(\theta)$$ sends signal
                             $$S|_{\theta=0}$$: $$c$$ -- cooperate and send correct data on secure channel. 
                             $$S|_{\theta=1}$$: with probability $$\alpha$$, experience a fault and send false data. With probability $$1-\alpha$$, send correct data. 
                             $$S|_{\theta=2}$$: with probability $$\beta$$, send correct data on secure channel. With probability $$1-\beta$$, send wrong data, or correct data on insecure, externally attacked channel. 
                         Second Move: $$R$$ takes action
                             $$s_{T}$$: trust data, $$s_{-T}$$: do not trust data

                         We assume we know the trust level $$T$$.

                         We could use our scenario with selfish (internal attacker) or trusted cloud (without external attacker) for a simple signalling game (Demonstration for Monday)

                     Introduction #slide #CI6280 
                         The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is a specific vulnerability scoring technique.
                         Developed by the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams ([FIRST](https://www.first.org/)).
                         Current version: v4.0, published in 2023. Still under active development!
                         CVSS provides an open framework for assessing the severity of software vulnerabilities, which is an industry-recognised standard
                     CVSS Version History #slide 
                         v1.0 (2005): The initial version focused on exploitability and impact, but lacked peer review and had limitations.
                         v2.0 (2007): Introduced environmental and temporal metrics, along with a refined scoring system for better accuracy.
                         v3.0 (2015): Major overhaul that incorporated exploitability, impact, and scope sub-scores, enabling more granular assessments.
                         v3.1 (2019): Minor updates clarified scoring and addressed edge cases to enhance consistency and usability.
                         v4.0 (2023): Significant changes include dynamic scoring based on attack patterns, improved environmental metrics, and a focus on attack surface reduction.
                     CVSS Scores #slide #CI6280 
                         A CVSS score is a quantity (numerical value), ranging from 0 to 10.
                         One use $$\mu:v \rightarrow [0, \ldots, 10]$$, the vulnerability score/metric function. 
                         An alternative qualitative representation consists of a vector, providing a compressed textual representation reflecting the values used to derive the score.
                         A CVSS Score consists of a base score, which can be refined by additional scores/metrics (temporal, environmental).
                         Generally, the organisation specifies the Base and Temporal metrics, while the environmental metric depends on the end-users.
                     CVSS Example: Heartbleed Bug #slide #CI6280 
                         ![Heartbleed-cvss.png](https://www.dropbox.com/s/o1o5ovl2zkk78te/Heartbleed-cvss.png?dl=1) #eyo-style:Normal 
                     CVSS v2.0 Base Score Equations #slide #CI7130 
                         In CVSS v2.0, the equation defining the Base Score is 
                             $$\mu_{Base} = k_1 \cdot \mu_{Imp} + k_2 \cdot \mu_{Exp} - k_3$$
                         where $$k_1 = 0.71$$, $$k_2 = 0.47$$ and $$k_3 = 1.76$$ (rounded to two decimal places) assuming $$\mu_{Imp} \neq 0$$. 
                         The Impact subscore $$\mu_{Imp}$$ describes potential impact that an exploit has on the system:
                             $$\mu_{Imp} = k_4 \cdot \mu_{CIA}$$
                         where $$k_4 = 10.41$$ and 
                             $$\mu_{CIA} = 1 - (1 - \mu_C)(1 - \mu_I)(1 - \mu_A).$$
                         Here $$\mu_C$$, $$\mu_I$$ and $$\mu_A$$ are the impacts on the individual security requirements CIA.
                     CVSS v3.0 Base Score #slide #CI6280 
                         "CVSS Base Score = CVSS Impact + CVSS Exploitability"
                             The base score $$\mu_{B}$$ represents the intrinsic and fundamental characteristics of $$v$$ that are independent of time and specific user environments.
                             The Impact subscore $$\mu_{Imp}$$ describes potential impact that an exploit has on the system
                             The Exploitability subscore $$\mu_{Exp}$$ describes the means and ease of exploiting the vulnerability. 
                         Each of the two sub-metrics contribute in an additive fashion to the final numerical score, ranging from 0 to 10.
                     CVSS v4.0 Updates #slide

                             CVSS v3: More comprehensive, nuanced, and adaptable scoring.
                             CVSS v2: Easier to understand and use, with improved accuracy.
                     Mini-Exercise: Understanding CVSS Scores #slide #CI7130 
                         Through this Mini-Exercise, you will better understand CVSS by analysing the scoring values for a given vulnerability.
                         (a) Find the CVSS v2 score of the famous Heartbleed vulnerability.
                             5
                         (b) Find also its string representation.
                             (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N). 
                         (c) Briefly sketch the meaning of two components of your choice in this vector notation and judge the credibility of this score.
                             For example:
                                 AV:N -- The access vector is through the network.
                                 C:P -- confidentiality is partially impacted upon. 
                             The Score of 5.0 seems somewhat low for this severe vulnerability.
                     Limitations #slide 
                         The main problem with vulnerability scoring is that two different vulnerabilities can have the same score, although they both have individual characteristics.
                         Whilst this is impossible to prevent in general, a careful design of the individual scoring functions should at least take this problem into account.
                         In the latest version CVSS 3, the scoring of vulnerabilities has improved -- e.g. some vulnerabilities are now scored higher than before.
                         We need a transition from a vulnerability-focused approach to a risk-based scoring system.

                 Random Oracle Model #slide 
                     A random oracle $$\mathcal O$$ is a deterministic function, mapping input into an output domain, following a uniformly random distribution. 
                     This can be used as a theoretical model for a range of cryptographic primitives:

                             Cryptography has given us strong encryption algorithms
                             Symmetric and asymmetric encryption standards are well-established and give reliable ways of protecting our data
                             However: relying only on encryption has also shortcomings
                             Main problem: key management and the underlying trust relationship 
                         Safeguarding a Cryptographic Key #slide  #CI7160 
                             Consider the task of storing a cryptographic key safely, especially in the context of mobile computing
                             We are facing a "chicken-and-egg" situation (why?)
                             We need a different, alternative cryptographic technique.

                         Secret Sharing -- Idea #slide #CI7160 
                             We want to protect sensitive information (the "secret"). 
                             Idea behind secret sharing: divide secret into several pieces ("shares") and distribute them to recipients ("shareholders"). 
                             Thus we can protect information by distributing it amongst several parties. 
                             Developed in the late 80's, secret sharing is not a new technique, but it is still an active research area and new applications are emerging. 
                             Let's do a jigsaw puzzle!
                         Introduction #slide #arman 
                             In secret sharing schemes a secret is distributed among a set of users $$\mathcal{P}$$ in such a way that only some sets, the authorised sets, can recover it. 
                             Secret sharing schemes are useful for not trusting a single party e.g. two members of staff required to open a vault. 
                             Similar challenges can arise in other sensitive areas where a secret should be recovered only if certain users, the authorised sets, get together. 
                         Secret Sharing -- Concept #slide #CI7160 #CI7160 
                             The following terminology is used: given a __secret __$$s$$, a __dealer __will divide it into __shares __and send them to $$n$$ __shareholders __(or__ players__). 
                             We have a ($$t$$,$$n$$)-threshold scheme, if for $$1\le t\le n$$:
                                 The secret $$s$$ can be divided into $$n$$ shares. 
                                 The individual shares do not reveal $$s$$. 
                                 If (at least) $$t$$ shares are combined, they can reconstruct $$s$$. 
                             A $$(n,n)$$-threshold scheme is also referred to as __secret splitting__ (similar to RAID 0).
                             A $$(1,n)$$-threshold scheme represents $$n$$ backups for redundancy (similar to RAID 1)

                         Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme #slide #CI7160 #modified
                             Secret sharing schemes are generally using mathematical objects that allow sharing and reconstructing. 
                             The most well-known scheme is Shamir's scheme, based on polynomial interpolation and modular arithmetic.
                             The underlying idea of this scheme is to convert the secret $$s$$ to a polynomial $$f(x)$$ with a suitable degree and coefficients over the integers modulo a suitable prime number $$p$$. 
                                 The degree of $$f$$ is $$t-1$$. 
                                 The secret $$s$$ will be stored in $$f(0)$$ -- this is the constant term of $$f$$. 
                                 All other coefficients of $$f$$ are drawn at random. 
                                 So, $$f(x)=s+a_1x+a_2x^2+\cdots+a_{t-1}x^{t-1}$$.
                         Share Creation and Reconstruction of Secret #slide #CI7160 
                             Distribution of shares works by __evaluating__ $$f$$ modulo $$p$$:
                                 We share $$n$$ distinct points $$P_i(x_i, f(x_i))$$ (for $$(i=1,\ldots,n$$) amongst the $$n$$ players. 
                             Reconstruction of the secret is based on __interpolation__. 
                                 A polynomial $$f(x)$$ of degree $$t-1$$ is uniquely determined by $$t$$ different points. 
                                 Hence a coalition of $$t$$ players can reconstruct $$f$$, using interpolation. 
                                 Any set of $$t$$ distinct points will be valid. 
                             This implements all properties required for a $$(t,n)$$ threshold scheme. 
                             It is sufficient to know the constant term $$a_0$$.

                         Shamir's Scheme: Choice of Evaluation Points #slide #CI7160
                             If we are working with the integers modulo $$p$$, then the $$x_i$$ can simply be the values $$x_1=1$$, $$x_2=2$$, $$x_3=3$$...
                             The $$x_i$$ could also be computed from some unique information related to the players, e.g. using a secure hash function $$H$$, from an ID value: $$x_i  = H(ID_i)$$.
                             This point generating algorithm could be made public. 
                             Hence there would be no need to actually send the $$x_i$$.
                             This would reduce the size of the data that needs distributing by 50\%!

                             Security
                                 Shamir's scheme is a __perfect__ secret sharing scheme. 
                                 This means that no information about the initial secret is revealed to a coalition of less than the threshold number ($$t$$) of players. 
                             Space-Requirements
                                 When done naively, for each share we require twice the size of the secret $$s$$. 
                                 This can be reduced to a share size of $$|__s__|$$ e.g. by using a public evaluation point function. 
                             Computational Cost
                                 Polynomial evaluation can be done in the order of $$t$$ arithmetic operations. 
                                 The same holds for interpolation. 
                         Mini-Exercise #slide #CI7160 
                             Use Shamir's approach to create a (2,3)-threshold scheme in order to share the secret $$s=3$$. Proceed as follows: 
                                 Choose a suitable polynomial function $$f$$ and prime number $$p$$
                                 Select two distinct points on the graph of $$f$$
                                 Compute two shares that could be distributed to players

                         Polynomial Interpolation #slide 
                             Goal: given $$(x_1, y_1),\ldots, (x_t, y_t)$$, how to explicitly construct a polynomial $$f$$ of degree $$t-1$$, satisfying $$f(x_i) = y_i$$ for all $$i$$?
                             We define the __Lagrange interpolation polynomial__ $$L_i(x)$$ of degree $$t-1$$ satisfying
                                 $$L_i(x_j) = 0$$ if $$i\neq j$$,
                                 $$L_i(x_j) = 1$$ otherwise.
                             We can then build the desired polynomial
                                 $$f(x) = y_1L_1(x) + \cdots + y_tL_t(x)$$.
                             We can state $$L_i(x)$$ explicity:
                                 $$L_{i}(x)=\prod_{1\le j \le t, i\neq j}\frac{x-x_i}{x_j-x_i}$$

                             Example: let us fix $$t=3$$ and choose the points

                                 $$x_2=5$$,

                             Then:
                                 $$L_1(x) = \frac{(x-5)(x+1)}{(2-5)(2+1)} = -\frac{1}{9} (x-5)(x+1) = -\frac{1}{9} (x^2-4x-5)$$
                                 $$L_2(x) = \frac{(x-2)(x+1)}{(5-2)(5+1)} = \frac{1}{18} (x-2)(x+1) = \frac{1}{18}(x^2-x-2)$$
                                 $$L_3(x) = \frac{(x-2)(x-5)}{(-1-2)(-1-5)} = \frac{1}{18}(x-2)(x-5) = \frac{1}{18}(x^2-7x+10)$$

                                     The scheme is a perfect secret sharing scheme: if $$|C|< k$$, then $$H(s|C)=H(s)$$.

                                 They are specific to the construction of the Shamir secret sharing scheme:
                                     Due to the unique interpolation property of $$f$$, given $$k$$ distinct points, one has: $$H (Q_{0},\ldots ,Q_{k-1} |F_{i_{1}},\ldots ,F_{i_{k}})=0$$.
                                     Based on evaluation of $$f$$ we can uniquely determine the shares, hence: $$H (F_{i_{1}},\ldots ,F_{i_{k}}|Q_{0},\ldots ,Q_{k-1} )=0$$.
                                     Due to the definition of the Shamir polynomial, we know $$S$$ if we know $$f$$: $$H (S|Q_{0},\ldots ,Q_{k-1})=H (S|S,Q_1,\ldots ,Q_{k-1})=0$$. #ref:shamir

                             Due to the unique interpolation property of $$f$$, given $$k$$ distinct points, one has: $$H (Q_{0},\ldots ,Q_{k-1} |F_{i_{1}},\ldots ,F_{i_{k}})=0$$.
                             If $$H(Y|Z)=0$$ then $$H(X|Y)\ge H(X|Z)$$ #ref:this 
                                 Applying identity #ref:this with $$Y=Q_{0},\ldots ,Q_{k-1}$$ yields $$H (S|Q_{0},\ldots ,Q_{k-1}) \ge H (S |F_{i_{1}},\ldots ,F_{i_{k}})$$.
                                     Applying #ref:this again gives $$H (S |F_{i_{1}},\ldots ,F_{i_{k}})\ge H (S|Q_{0},\ldots ,Q_{k-1})$$.
                                         Hence $$H (S|Q_{0},\ldots ,Q_{k-1}) = H (S |F_{i_{1}},\ldots ,F_{i_{k}})$$.
                                             But this is 0, and hence $$H (S |F_{i_{1}},\ldots ,F_{i_{k}})=0$$.

                                                 And then also $$0\le H (S |F_{i_{1}},\ldots ,F_{i_{t}})\le H (S |F_{i_{1}},\ldots ,F_{i_{k}}) =0$$ due to #ref:that which finishes the proof.

                                     Based on evaluation of $$f$$ we can uniquely determine the shares, hence: $$H (F_{i_{1}},\ldots ,F_{i_{k}}|Q_{0},\ldots ,Q_{k-1} )=0$$.
                                     Due to the definition of the Shamir polynomial: $$H (S|Q_{0},\ldots ,Q_{k-1})=H (S|S,Q_1,\ldots ,Q_{k-1})=0$$.

                             Consider a scenario where Alice has some confidential data, which she would like to store on a public cloud. 
                             However, she is using Dropbox, which does not offer end-to-end encryption. 
                             Hence she would like to implement the following security goals:
                                 Confidentiality versus the cloud provider (and external parties). 
                                 Availability (redundancy) in case of hard disk failure or unavailability of Dropbox. 
                         Cloud Security Scenario -- Solution #slide #CI7160 
                             Alice splits her data into several "pieces" and stores each on a different cloud (Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, OneDrive, iCloud)
                             This needs be done in such a way that none of the cloud providers can read the original information
                             Entire data can be restored from a subset of $$t$$ pieces
                             What is the redundancy of this architecture?

                                     PGP client software uses a (5,3) secret sharing scheme to store the user's private key.

                                 When using secret sharing in real-world scenarios, there are many additional requirements in terms of security, robustness, flexibility, efficiency and scalability
                                 __Dealer-free__ (or __distributed__) secret sharing scheme -- no central dealer, players cooperate jointly
                                 __Verifiable secret sharing scheme__ -- protect against malicious dealers
                                 __Proactive secret sharing scheme__ -- update/change shares, maintain secret
                                 __Dynamic secret sharing scheme__ -- we can add or remove players (change $$n$$), and change the threshold $$t$$
                             Dealer-Free Random Secret Sharing (RSS) #slide #CI7160 #CI7160 
                                 Goal: mutually create and distribute shares of a random secret without the need for centralised dealer
                                 Ideal in peer-to-peer scenario where all players have equal capabilities
                                 Principle: each player $$P_i$$ creates random value and distributes its shares to all other players
                                 So, each player effectively acts as a dealer
                                 Final secret is the sum of the individual secrets
                             RSS Share Distribution Protocol #slide #CI7160 
                                 Stage 1: Creating and sending primary shares
                                     Each $$P_i$$ creates a random polynomial $$f_i(x)$$ of degree $$t-1$$
                                     So, for each player, $$s_i = f_i(0)$$ is her (partial) secret 
                                     $$P_i$$ sends the share $$f_i(j)$$ of $$s_i$$ to all other $$P_j$$, using a secure channel
                                 Stage 2: Receiving auxiliary shares
                                     Each $$P_i$$ receives $$f_j(i)$$ from all other $$P_j$$, using a secure channel
                                     The final share for $$P_i$$ is then $$f_1(i) + \ldots + f_n(i)$$
                                     Outcome: all parties share the random value $$f_1(0) + \ldots + f_n(0) = f(0)$$, although none of them know this value!

                             Ramp Secret Sharing Scheme #slide 
                                 Goal: be more space-efficient and store larger secrets (applications: cloud computing)
                                 A ramp secret sharing scheme is a particular type of secret sharing scheme that introduces a threshold structure with "ramp" properties
                                 Some subsets of participants can partially recover the secret, but not fully, unless they reach a higher threshold.
                                 Let there be $$n$$ participants $$P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_n$$.
                                 The secret $$S$$ is distributed among these participants as shares $$X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$$.
                             Thresholds:
                                 There are two thresholds, $$t_1$$ and $$t_2$$, where $$t_1 < t_2$$.
                                 Any subset of $$t_1$$ or fewer participants gains no information about the secret $$S$$. 
                                 This is formalized as $$I(S; X_{i_1}, X_{i_2}, \ldots, X_{i_{t_1}}) = 0$$ where $$\{ i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_{t_1} \}$$ is any subset of size $$t_1$$ or smaller.
                                 Any subset of $$t_2$$ or more participants can fully reconstruct the secret $$S$$. 
                                 This is expressed as $$H(S | X_{j_1}, X_{j_2}, \ldots, X_{j_{t_2}}) = 0$$ where $$\{ j_1, j_2, \ldots, j_{t_2} \}$$ is any subset of size $$t_2$$ or larger.
                             Partial Information for Intermediate Subsets #slide 
                                 For any subset of participants whose size is between $$t_1$$ and $$t_2$$, they may have partial information about the secret $$S$$. 
                                 In this range, the mutual information between the secret and the subset's shares is non-zero, but the entropy of the secret conditioned on these shares is still positive:
                                     $$0 < I(S; X_{k_1}, X_{k_2}, \ldots, X_{k_{m}}) < H(S)$$ and $$H(S | X_{k_1}, X_{k_2}, \ldots, X_{k_{m}}) > 0$$ where $$t_1 < m < t_2$$.
                             Information Theoretic Security #slide 
                                 The scheme is information-theoretically secure against coalitions of up to $$t_1$$ participants because the mutual information between the secret and the shares of any subset of size $$t_1$$ or less is zero.
                                 Information gained by subsets of participants between $$t_1$$ and $$t_2$$ participants is less than complete but more than nothing, reflecting the "ramp" nature of the scheme.
                             Share Size #slide 
                                 The share size typically grows as the total information distributed increases, especially if the scheme uses randomization or other techniques to manage the gradual leakage of information between the thresholds $$t_1$$ and $$t_2$$.
                             Summary
                                 
                             A Method #slide 
                                 We still use a polynomial as in Shamir's scheme
                                 However, rather than storing the secret in only one coefficient, we could also use all __t__ coefficients
                                 This would allow for a __t__-times larger secret as in Shamir
                                 However, a security analysis reveals that this will leak some information, so not a perfect secret sharing scheme
                                 We will not go into details, but this is current active research

                                 This could be caused by attacks on servers (aka players)
                                 Important application: key distribution in (wireless) sensor networks, MANETs
                                 Classic scheme: Herzberg
                                 Idea: refresh shares, but maintain same secret
                                 Advantage: attacker has to compromise t servers before refreshing period, instead during entire lifespan of system

                                 Similar approach as in proactive scheme
                                 Idea: each player contributes to new shares
                                 However, not very efficient:
                                     Communication effort

                                 Protocol is not very efficient
                                 There are O(__n^__2) values to communicate
                                 Also there are some hidden flaws -- e.g. we need to guarantee that the degree of __f__ is guaranteed to be exactly __t__-1
                                 Finding a more efficient and robust solution is the topic of current research

                                 VPSNs
                                     Relatively new concept (Conti et al, 2010)
                                     Goal: create a “protected” social network within a bigger “carrier” social network
                                     Information will be shared amongst users of the VPSN and is confidential w.r.t. social network provider
                                     Idea (Clarke et al, 2013): combine secret sharing and steganography
                                 Peer-to-Peer Networks
                                     P2P network: no infrastructure, all nodes are the same, decentralised network
                                     MANET (Mobile Ad-hoc Network): wireless links, spontaneous, self organising
                                     This makes it very difficult to have a CA (seems contradictory concept)
                                     Even if there was one, it would be easy to attack it and to compromise the system
                                     Create a distributed CA by using threshold cryptography (secret sharing) -- here, a private key is shared among several nodes

                                 Idea: run share-renewal protocol:
                                     Each player $$P_i$$ chooses random update polynomial $$h_i(x)$$ with constant term 0
                                     $$P_i$$ updates all other players through a secure channel by sending $$h_i(j)$$
                                     $$P_i$$ receives $$h_j(i)$$ from all other $$P_j$$
                                     Player $$P_i$$ can then compute its new share as:
                                         $$siT+1 = siT + h1(i) + ∙∙∙ + hn(i)$$
                                     All old data is then erased
                                 This is correct, robust and secret in the presence of passive adversaries

                                 Goal: increase n whilst keeping t
                                 This is the Group Joining Problem
                                 Problem: Pn+1 needs new share f(n+1)
                                 Assume Lagrange: $$f(x) = y_1L_1(x) + \cdots + y_tL_t(x)$$
                                 We have yi = f(i)
                                 But the f(i) are known by the Pi
                                 So, if Pn+1 contacts t nodes, it can compute its share, provided the Li can also be computed
                                 However: then Pn+1 would know Pi's share
                                 Solution: use PSS (Herzberg) to send new (refreshed) shares
                                 Note: more efficient non-interactive solution exists
                             Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS) #slide 
                                 In a secret sharing scheme, each of several parties receive shares of a secret value and it may be important that those shares can be checked for correctness
                                 In a verifiable secret sharing scheme, the distribution of a secret is accompanied by commitments to the individual shares
                                 The commitments reveal nothing that can help a dishonest player, but the shares allow each individual party to check to see if their shares are correct
                             VSS -- Feldman Approach #slide 
                                 The dealer generates the polynomial $$f(x) = s + a_1x + \cdots + a_{t-1}x^{t-1}$$ (as in Shamir)
                                 Distributes shares $$f(x_i)$$ and creates commitments of coefficients $$a_k$$
                                 These are of the form $$c_k = g^{a_k}$$ where $$g$$ is a suitable value (also published)
                                 The commitments are broadcasted to all parties
                                 Players can now verify a share $$s_i$$ as they can compute $$g^{s_i}$$ themselves
                             Verification: How It Works #slide 
                                 The verification works as follows: $$P_i$$ computes $$g^{s_i}$$ and compares this value with
                                     $$g^{f(i)} = g^{a_0 + a_1^i + \cdots + a_{t-1}^{i^{t-1}}}$$
                                     $$= g^{a_0}\cdot g^{a_1^i} \cdot g^{a_2^{i^2}} \cdots g^{a_{t-1}^{i^{t-1}}}$$
                                     = $$c_0\cdot c_1^i \cdot c_2^{i^2} \cdots c_{t-1}^{i^{t-1}}$$
                                 If these values are the same, the share is correct
                                 Otherwise: either dealer cheated, or there was an error during transmission

                             Introduction #slide #arman
                                 The secret is (part of) a bivariate polynomial $$f(x, y)$$.
                                 Let $$P_1, P_2,...,P_n$$ be players involved in the sharing scheme.
                                 We have the following definitions:
                                     Symmetric bivariate SS -- the polynomial $$f$$ is symmetric ($$f(x,y) = f(y,x)$$).
                                     Asymmetric BSS otherwise.
                                 The are several applications of BSS:
                                     Multi-secret sharing
                                     Key agreement

                                 Principle: write $$f(x,y)$$ as a matrix $$F = ((a_{i,j}))$$ where $$f(x, y) = \sum^m_{i=0} \sum^m_{i=0} a_{ij} x^i y^j \pmod{p}$$.
                                 Create shares by evaluating $$f$$ at various points, e.g. $$f(x_i,y), f(x,y_i)$$ or $$f(x_i,y_i)$$. [Depending on application]
                                 Reconstruct $$f$$ by creating invertible Vandermonde matrix from a coalition of shares/players.

                                 Each Player receives $$g_i(y)=f(x_i, y)$$.
                                 Reconstruction of $$f(x,y)$$ is based on $$V(x_1, ...,x_n) \cdot F = \begin{bmatrix} \text{coeffs}_y(g_1) \\ \vdots \\ \text{coeffs}_y(g_m) \end{bmatrix}$$ and inverting $$V(x_{i_1}, ....,x_{i_k})$$.
                                 Similarly, the scheme could be using $$h_j(y)=f(x,y_j)$$: 
                                     $$F \cdot V(y_1,...,y_n)^t = \begin{bmatrix} \text{coeffs}_x(f(x,y)) \\ \vdots \\ \text{coeffs}_x(f(x,y_n)) \end{bmatrix}$$
                                 But this is not different to running multiple instances of Shamir SS.

                                     There are two sets of players:

                                     Each set has associated thresholds $$k$$ and $$l$$.
                                     A coalition of at least $$k$$ players of $$P$$ and at least $$l$$ players of $$Q$$ can reconstruct the secret.
                                     Any coalition with less than these players do not gain (any? all?) information about the secret.

                                     Given a secret $$s$$, we create a bivariate polynomial $$f(x,y)$$ with $$\deg_x f = k-1$$ and $$\deg_y f = l-1$$.
                                     We set $$f(0,0) = s$$ and $$f(i,j)$$ is random $$(i,j \neq 0)$$.
                                     Furthermore, we form the matrix $$B := ((b_{ij}))$$ where $$1 \leq i \leq n, 1 \leq j \leq n$$, and 
                                         $$b_{ij} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & x_i & \cdots & x_i^{k-1} \end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix} a_{0j} \\ a_{1j} \\ \vdots \\ a_{kj} \end{bmatrix} - \begin{bmatrix}a_{i0} & a_{i1} & \cdots & a_{il} \end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ y_j \\ \vdots \\ y^{l-1}_j \end{bmatrix}$$.

                             Access Structures #slide #arman
                                 Given a set of players $$\mathcal{P} = \{{P}_1, \ldots , {P}_n\}$$, the family $$\Gamma \subset 2^\mathcal{P}$$ of __authorized sets__ is the __access structure__ of the secret sharing scheme.
                                 Example: for $$n=3$$ parties $$P_1 , P_2, P_3$$ that participate in a secret sharing scheme with threshold $$k=2$$, the authorised sets are $$\{P_1, P_2\}$$, $$\{P_1 , P_3\}$$, $$\{P_2, P_3\}$$ and $$\{P_1, P_2, P_3\}$$.
                                 A collection $$\Gamma \subseteq 2^\mathcal{P}$$ is __monotone__ if: $$\mathcal{V} \in \Gamma$$ and $$\mathcal{V} \subseteq \mathcal{W} \Rightarrow \mathcal{W} \in \Gamma $$.
                                 Usually, access structures are monotone collections.
                             Compartmented Access Structures #slide #arman 
                                 Denote $$\mathcal{C} = \{\mathcal{C}_1,...,\mathcal{C}_m \}$$ a partition of $$\mathcal{P}$$ into $$m$$ disjoint subsets, or __compartments__: $$\mathcal{P} = \bigcup^m_{i=1} \mathcal{C}_i$$.
                                 Let 
                                     $$t_i \in \mathbb{N}$$ ($$1 \leq i \leq m$$), and $$\sum^m_{i=1} t_i \le t \in \mathbb{N}$$,
                                     $$s_i \in \mathbb{N}$$ ($$1 \leq i \leq m$$), and $$\sum^m_{i=1} s_i \ge s \in \mathbb{N}$$. 
                                 A __compartemented access structure__ with __lower__ (__upper__ respectively) __bounds__ consists of all subsets containing at least $$t_i$$ (at most $$s_i$$) participants from $$C_i$$ for $$1 \leq i \leq m$$, and a total of at least $$t$$ ($$s$$ respectively) participants.
                                 Formally: 
                                     $$\Gamma = \{\mathcal{V} \subseteq \mathcal{P} : \exists \mathcal{W} \subseteq \mathcal{V}$$ such that $$|\mathcal{W} \cap \mathcal{C}_i | \geq t_i, 1 \leq i \leq m$$, and $$ |\mathcal{W}| = t \}$$.
                                     $$\Delta= \{\mathcal{V} \subseteq \mathcal{P} : \exists \mathcal{W} \subseteq \mathcal{V}$$ such that $$|\mathcal{W} \cap \mathcal{C}_i | \le s_i, 1 \leq i \leq m$$, and $$ |\mathcal{W}| = s \}$$.
                                 Original notion by @Simmons had $$\sum^m_{i=1} t_i = t $$, later generalised by @Brickell. 
                             Multipartite Access Structures #slide #arman 
                                 Let $$\Gamma \in 2^\mathcal{P}$$ be a compartmented access structure.
                                 An $$m$$-__partite__ (or __multipartite__) access structure on $$\mathcal{P}$$ with respect to partition $$\mathcal{C}$$ is any access structure that does not distinguish between members of the same compartment.
                                 Formally:
                                     Assume that for all permutations $$\pi : \mathcal{P} \rightarrow \mathcal{P}$$ such that $$\pi(\mathcal{C}_i) =\mathcal{C_i}\;(1 \leq i \leq m), \;\mathcal{V} \in \Gamma$$ if and only if $$\pi(\mathcal{V}) \in \Gamma$$. 
                                     Then $$\Gamma$$ is called $$m$$-__partite__ or __multipartite__ with respect to partition $$\mathcal{C}$$.
                                 Given any subset $$\mathcal{W} \subseteq \mathcal{U}$$, its __type__ with respect to partition (1) is the vector $$(t_1,...,t_m) \in \mathbb{N}^m $$, where $$t_i = |\mathcal{W} \cap \mathcal{C}_i |, 1 \leq i \leq m.$$

                                     The set of elements of $$\mathcal{V}$$ are also elements of $$\mathcal{U}$$.
                                     There exists a set $$\mathcal{V}$$ such that the number of elements that are in common with set $$\mathcal{W}$$ and $$\mathcal{C}_i$$ is greater than $$t_i$$. 
                                         where $$\mathcal{C}_i$$ is a set of participants in a compartment and $$\mathcal{U}$$ is a set of all participants in all compartments?
                                     $$i$$ is not less than l or greater than $$m$$ and the number of elements in $$\mathcal{W}$$ is $$t$$. 
                                         where $$m$$ is the number of compartments and $$t$$ is the number of participants.
                                     So is subset of participants that are at least size $$t$$ ($$t$$ out of $$n$$?) which are authorised to recover their secret? 
                                 The sets in $$\Gamma$$ are called the authorised sets, and the sets not in $$\mathbb{A}$$ are called the unauthorised sets.
                                     An access structure (respectivily, monotonic access structure) is a collection (respectively, monotone collection) $$\Gamma$$ of non-empty subsets of $$\{P_1,P_2 ,..., P_n\}$$, i.e., $$\Gamma \subseteq 2^{\{P_1,P_2,...,P_n\}} \setminus \{\emptyset\}$$.

                                     Assume the points $$P_1(x_1,y_1),\ldots,P_{k-1}(x_{k-1},y_{k-1})$$ are pre-defined with distinct abscissae $$x_i$$ and uniformly random ordinates $$y_i$$. Then the scheme is a perfect secret sharing scheme. #theorem 
                                 Idea of proof: 
                                     We will show that the polynomial $$f$$ has uniformly random distributed coefficients. The claim then follows from the properties of Shamir's scheme. 
                             Proof #slide 
                                 The matrix $V$ is a Vandermonde-matrix
                                     $$V = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & x_1 & x_1^2 & \cdots & x_1^{k-1} \\ 1 & x_2 & x_2^2 & \cdots & x_2^{k-1} \\ \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & &\vdots \\ 1 & x_n & x_n^2 & \cdots & x_n^{k-1} \end{pmatrix}$$.
                                 We require the following random variables:
                                     $$X$$: the vector of $$x_i$$ 
                                     $$Y$$: the vector of $$y_i$$ 
                                     $$Q$$: the coefficients of Shamir polynomial
                                     $$V$$
                             Lemma #slide 
                                 Let $$\sigma$$ be a bijection. Then for any $$X$$
                                     $$H(\sigma(X))=H(X)$$.
                                 Proof:
                                     $$H(\sigma(X))\le H(X)$$ and $$H(\sigma^{-1}(X))\le H(X)$$ hence $$H(X)=H(\sigma^{-1}(\sigma(X)))\le H(\sigma(X))\le H(X)$$ from which the claim follows.
                             Proof #slide 
                                 We have $$Y=V(X)Q$$ and that $$V$$ is invertible due to the distinct $$x_i$$.
                                 It follows 
                                     $$H(Y|X)=H(V^{}(X)Q)=H(Q)$$ 
                                 due to the the lemma.
                                 Since $$Y$$ is random, $$H(Q)=H(Y|X)=H(Y)=\log_2|\mathbb{F}|^{k}$$ which finishes the proof.

                                         This might be beneficial, depending on the nature of the underlying communication channel

                                 Useful Identities #slide 
                                     The following identities are specific to the construction of the Shamir secret sharing scheme:
                                         Due to the unique interpolation property of $$f$$, given $$k$$ distinct points, one has: $$H (Q_{0},\ldots ,Q_{k-1} |F_{i_{1}},\ldots ,F_{i_{k}})=0$$.
                                         Based on evaluation of $$f$$ we can uniquely determine the shares, hence: $$H (F_{i_{1}},\ldots ,F_{i_{k}}|Q_{0},\ldots ,Q_{k-1} )=0$$.
                                         Due to the definition of the Shamir polynomial: $$H (S|Q_{0},\ldots ,Q_{k-1})=H (S|S,Q_1,\ldots ,Q_{k-1})=0$$.
                                 Proof: Correctness #slide 
                                     Applying 4th identity with $$Y=Q_{0},\ldots ,Q_{k-1}$$ yields $$H (S|Q_{0},\ldots ,Q_{k-1}) \ge H (S |F_{i_{1}},\ldots ,F_{i_{k}})$$.
                                     Applying again gives $$H (S |F_{i_{1}},\ldots ,F_{i_{k}})\ge H (S|Q_{0},\ldots ,Q_{k-1})$$
                                     Hence $$H (S|Q_{0},\ldots ,Q_{k-1}) = H (S |F_{i_{1}},\ldots ,F_{i_{k}})$$
                                     Hence $$H (S |F_{i_{1}},\ldots ,F_{i_{k}})=0$$
                                     And also $$H (S |F_{i_{1}},\ldots ,F_{i_{t}})=0$$

                             A secure commitment scheme is a protocol implementing a game between Alice and Bob. 
                             Alice wants to reveal information in the future but keep it confidential for now. 
                             This means that Alice chooses a secret $$s$$ and only reveals it later
                             Bob is able to verify later that the revealed value is indeed the original secret
                             A commitment can represent the proof of this information whilst preserving the privacy. 
                             When it is revealed, the commitment will verify the revealed information.
                             An important additional feature of the protocol: both players do not necessarily have to trust each other (they might try to cheat). 
                         Motivation: Real-World Examples #slide 
                             Example 1
                                 A head-and-tail game (using a coin) between Alice and Bob
                             Example 2
                                 Peggy makes a bet that a certain person will win a race. 
                                 Before the race starts Peggy makes a commitment and sends it to Victor. 
                                 After the race has finished, Peggy can reveal who she thought was going to win which allows Victor to verify the truth.
                         Properties #slide #proto #CI7100
                             Protocol proceeds in two stages: commit($$x$$) and reveal($$x$$)
                             Alice executes the commit stage in order to commit to $$x$$
                             Later, she applies reveal in order to open the secret
                             Essential properties:
                                 Binding: Alice cannot change $$x$$ without being detected
                                 Hiding: Bob cannot learn $$x$$ before reveal
                         Ideal Commitment Model #slide #proto #CI7100
                             Use TTP, with which every user can communicate securely
                             Commit(x):
                                 Alice sends x to the TTP in a confidential and authenticated manner
                                 TTP creates nonce c and stores (c,x)
                                 TTP returns c to Alice
                             Reveal(x):
                                 Bob sends reveal command to TTP
                                 TTP publishes (c,x)
                             This is perfectly secure
                         Bit Commitment Using Hash Function – Basic Protocol #slide #proto #CI7100
                             Bit commitment scheme: $$x=b$$ is either 0 or 1
                             Alice wants to commit to a bit $$b$$ without revealing it to Bob
                             Why can she not simply send $$H(b)$$?
                             Protocol works as follows (assuming a secure channel):
                             Commit($$b$$):
                                 Alice generates a random bit-string $$R$$
                                 She creates message containing $$b$$ by forming $$m=(R,b)$$
                                 Alice now sends to Bob: $$H(m)$$
                             Reveal($$b$$):
                                 Alice sends $$m$$ to Bob
                                 Bob re-computes hash, checking it
                         Security of the Protocol #slide #proto #CI7100
                             Why is this binding?
                                 If Alice changes $$b$$, the output of the hash function will be different
                                 Due to collision-resistance, this will be detected
                             Why is this hiding?
                                 Bob only knows hash digest
                                 Due to pre-image attack resistance, he cannot access $$b$$
                         Bit Commitment Using Hash Function -- Strengthened Protocol #slide #proto #CI7100
                             Commit($$b$$):
                                 Bob creates random bit-string $$R_1$$ and sends it to Alice
                                 Alice also generates a random bit-string $$R_2$$
                                 She creates message containing $$b$$ by forming $$(R_1,R_2,b)$$
                                 Alice now sends $$H(R_1,R_2,b),R_1$$ to Bob, who records value 
                             Reveal($$b$$):
                                 Alice sends Bob: $$(R_1,R_2,b)$$
                                 Bob recomputes hash, checking it with recorded value
                         Protection Mechanisms #slide #proto #CI7100
                             We will explain the purpose of $$R_1$$ and $$R_2$$ (they are “nonces” or “random coins”)
                             Purpose of $$R_2$$: Hiding -- as in the previous basic protocol
                                 This gives protection for Alice's bit $$b$$
                                 Bob cannot invert $$H$$, so cannot deduce $$b$$
                             Purpose of $$R_1$$: Binding
                                 To strengthen Bob's protection
                                 Alice (or any other attacker) cannot find $$R_2'$$ with $$H(R_2, 0) = H(R_2, 1)$$ as in the previous protocol
                                 Even if she could, this forces the need for different collisions  in each protocol run
                         Applications #slide #proto #CI7100 
                             Secure commitment schemes are building blocks
                             They have applications for more advanced protocols
                                 A secure commitment scheme can help ensuring the correct outcome of a computation or protocol
                                 This is achieved by committing to some (crucial) intermediate parameters
                                 The security goals are initial sender data confidentiality and integrity.

                                 A __Zero-Knowledge Proof/Protocol__ (ZKP) is a method by which one party (the __prover__) can prove to another party (the __verifier__) that a given statement __S__ is true.
                                 Apart from the fact that the statement is indeed true, no other information must be conveyed.
                                 This is the main challenge, as it is trivial to e.g. prove that one possesses knowledge of certain information by simply revealing it.
                             ZKP as a Protocol #slide
                                 A good way to implement a ZKP is an asymmetric protocol, involving __Peggy__ (prover) and __Victor__ (verifier).
                                 This is usually done by Peggy computing proof a that __S__ is correct, and providing this to Victor.
                                 where Victor creates a challenge in order to verify it derived by their  respective secret values.
                                 Protocol can be __interactive__ or __non-interactive__.
                             ZKP Properties #slide
                                 There are 3 main properties:
                                     __Completeness__ -- if the statement is true, an honest prover will convince the verifier. The verifier will have confidence that the prover knows the information that they didn't reveal.
                                     __Soundness__ -- if the statement is false, the verifier will find out the prover is dishonest with a very high probability. So there cannot be an instance of a protocol run where false information can be verified by Victor.
                                     __Zero knowledge__ -- no extra information is revealed to the verifier.
                             ZKP Security #slide 
                                 ZKP Protocols are usually secure in terms of either 
                                     the RSA Prime-Multiplication Trapdoor function or 
                                     the Discrete Logarithm Problem 
                                 for classical computers. 
                                 They are potentially vulnerable to Schor's Algorithm/quantum computers.
                             Specific ZKP Example #slide 
                                 Peggy attempts to prove she knows $$x$$ to Victor but without revealing $$x$$ at any point.
                                 Here $$x$$ can represent any structured data, especially as it can be represented through a secure hash.
                                 This ZKP protocol effectively gives Victor access to a private version of the identity test function $$\mathsf{Id:x\to x}$$. 
                                 Victor verifies $$x = \mathsf{Id (x)}$$. 
                         Example Scenarios #h 
                             A Simple Interactive ZKP #slide 
                                 A: a very simple example: Peggy wants to convince Victor, that she possesses a certain key.
                                 Idea: rather than showing the key, she demonstrates that she can open the corresponding lock.
                                 This needs to be done with care so that the protocol remains zero-knowledge:
                                     Victor must not be able to see the key in a close up
                                     Otherwise, information can leak!

                             Zero-knowledge Glassdoor #slide 
                                 Goal: two employees (Peggy and Victor) want to know whether they earn the same salary. 
                                 Or else a bank giving a loan. 
                                 They do not want to disclose how much money they get if their salaries are not the same.
                                 Approach:
                                     Peggy prepares envelopes, each labelled with some salary amounts (including one with her own). 
                                     Victor places notes in each (in Peggy's absence), with one "yes" and all others "no". 
                                     Peggy opens the envelope labeled with her salary (when Peggy is present) and reveals the note. 
                                 Remark: can Peggy or Victor cheat?

                                 In the classic tale of Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves, the cave is used to demonstrate knowledge of the hidden secret, to a third party.
                                 The cave has two forks A and B which are at first glance a dead end.

                                 The thieves are able to evade their pursuers by using a secret passphrase which opens a wall between A and B.
                                 One can demonstrate knowing this secret by having an observer at the fork flip a coin to decide which side the prover must appear from. 
                                 Each time this is tested, the chance of success by someone not knowing the secret is halved. 
                                 The randomisation is put in place in order to rule out collusion between the prover and verifier.

                                 Two different agencies (banks, or government institutions) share a record of customers
                                 They occasionally receive records about criminal allegations
                                 They want to compare evidence for a given, shared customer
                                 If the evidence is not the same, this should not be revealed
                                 In particular, this is useful if one of the agencies has not received any allegation.
                                 Here, a ZKP is the suitable solution!

                 how about this for required outputs from each of the first, second and third stages:
                 1) Each bank processes every transaction to produce a signal, and share this with an auditor. 
                     From the data contained in the signal, it shall not be possible for any unauthorised entity to infer the 'to' or 'from' bank account, or sort code. For stage 1, the auditor would be unauthorised.
                     The amount and timestamp data will not be redacted at stage 1, i.e. the auditor is able to infer and use these elements of data about each transaction that it receives, in stage 2.
                 2) The auditor associates a probability of money-laundering to each transaction, and makes this information available to the banks. 
                     Note that the 'to' and 'from' account+sort codes are by necessity redacted. 
                     For each transaction, the auditor shall either i) disclose this associated data available only to the source bank, or ii) publish to the community of banks. both routes have their security advantages. Hybrid approaches may also be possible.
                     Note that the auditor may choose to only disclose/publish the transactions for which the probability exceeds a given value, i.e. those intended for inclusion in an SAR. This disclosure/publication activity then becomes in effect a request to reveal bank account+ sort code. 
                     It may also be possible for the auditor encrypt other aspects of the transaction, including the timestamp, amount,  and the probability of money-laundering. This way, only the source bank will be privy to these elements of data. This is especially relevant if route (ii) is chosen, but could also be useful for (i), i.e. for internal bank security. 
                 3) The auditor and banks work together to produce an SAR for each set of transactions with a sufficiently high probability of money-laundering. 
                     An SAR is defined as a list of transactions.
                     For each transaction, unless the 'from' bank has authorised the disclosure, the 'from' bank account+sort code is encrypted. Similarly, for each transaction, unless the 'to' bank has authorised the disclosure, the 'to' bank account+sort code is encrypted. 
                     An interactive workflow to request authorisation (and hence revelation) of plaintext bank account / sort code is suggested

                     Return on Investment (ROI) and Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) #slide
                         Both are financial analysis methods, used to evaluate the financial impact of a proposed investment or project. 
                         Key differences between the two:
                             ROI is a simpler and more specific metric.
                             It focuses on the return on the investment.
                             CBA takes a broader view of the costs and benefits of the investment. 
                             It attempts to quantify both __tangible__ and __intangible__ (or "soft") costs and benefits.
                             Usually over a longer period of time. 
                         They can also be combined.
                     ROI -- Definition #slide 
                         ROI is a relative measure that calculates the net gain or loss from an investment or spending.
                         This provides a measure of the profitability of the investment.
                         The deeper meaning of ROI is the measurement of the efficiency of an investment. 
                         It takes into account both the benefits gained and the costs incurred, using a mathematic equation.
                     ROI -- Calculation #slide 
                         Informal equation: 
                             $$\text{ROI} = \frac{\text{benefits from investment} - \text{cost of investment}}{\text{cost of investment}}$$
                         Formal definition: 
                             Denote $$\rho$$ the ROI, $$b$$ and $$c$$ resp. the benefit and costs.
                             Then $$\rho:=\frac{b-c}{c}=\frac{b}{c}-1$$.
                         Hence, the ROI is calculated by 
                             1) Subtracting the initial investment from the expected total return (benefit) on the investment,
                             2) Dividing this by the initial investment. 
                     Investment Utility Function Definition #slide 
                         So, values $$\rho > 0$$ indicate that the returns exceed the costs of the investment.
                         Any return $$\mu < \rho$$ is a feasible return.
                         Another form sometimes used is the investment utility function
                             $$u(\lambda):=b-(\lambda+1)c-{b}$$.
                         One has
                             $$\rho+1=\frac{b}{c} \Longrightarrow u(\rho)=b-(\rho+1)c=0$$.
                         So we have for the investment utility function:
                             $$u(\mu) \ge 0$$ if $$\mu$$ is feasible and
                             the ROI is the maximal feasible value. 
                     Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) #slide 
                         The Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) is the monetary value expected for a single loss from a threat or risk.
                         The formula for SLE is: $$\text{SLE} = \text{AV} \times \text{EF}$$
                         Here:
                             the Asset Value (AV) is the estimated value of the asset at risk
                             the Exposure Factor (EF) is the percentage of the asset value that would be lost if the risk event occurs.
                     Annual Loss Expectancy (ALE) #slide 
                         The Annual Loss Expectancy (ALE) calculates the total expected loss from a single loss event, repeated throughout the year.
                         It can be defined as the product
                             $$\text{ALE}$$ = $$\text{SLE} \times \text{ARO}$$.
                         Here:
                             SLE is the monetary value expected from a single occurrence of a risk (see previous definition),
                             ARO is the number of times a risk is expected to occur in a year.
                         The ALE for $$n$$ assets can be defined as the sum of the individual ALEs:
                             $$\text{ALE} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{SLE}_i \times \text{ARO}_i$$
                         Here $$\text{SLE}_i$$ is the Single Loss Expectancy, and $$\text{ARO}_i$$ is the Annual Rate of Occurrence for the $$i$$-th asset.
                     Mini-Exercise #slide 
                         You are the IT security manager of a small company that processes sensitive customer data. The company has recently experienced a security breach that resulted in the loss of 500 customer records. The company's CEO has asked you to provide a report on the breach's potential financial impact and recommend measures to prevent future incidents.
                         Each customer record has a value of $50. The company has experienced two similar security breaches in the past three years. Implementing security measures would cost $10,000 annually.
                         Tasks:
                             0. What are the costs and what are the benefits in this scenario?
                             1. Calculate the SLE.
                             2. Estimate the ARO.
                             3. Calculate the ALE.
                             4. Calculate the ROI of implementing security measures.
                             5. Plot the investment utility function.
                             6. Recommend suitable security measures.
                     Solution #slide 
                         The Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) of the security breach can be determined by estimating the cost of the loss that could result from a single incident: SLE = $50 x 500 = $25,000.
                         The Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO) of a security breach can be estimated by determining how often similar security breaches have occurred in the past: ARO = 2 / 3 = 0.67.
                         The Annual Loss Expectancy (ALE) can be calculated by multiplying the SLE by the ARO: ALE = $25,000 x 0.67 = $16,750.
                         To calculate the ROI of implementing security measures, divide the potential cost savings (ALE) by the cost of the security measures: ROI = ($16,750 - $10,000) / $10,000 = 0.675 or 67.5%.
                         Based on the ROI, it is recommended to implement the security measures as they would result in a positive return on investment. The company can consider measures such as enhancing access controls, implementing intrusion detection and prevention systems, and providing security awareness training to employees.

                             We would like to apply the previous ideas to more complex assets.
                             A logical asset is a system, composed of several sub-systems. 
                             We examine a system $$a$$ with $$m>1$$ components $$a_1, \ldots, a_m$$.
                             Also, we might want to implement several security investments (controls/security policies).
                             Denote $$n>1$$ the number of these different types of security investments $$I_1, \ldots, I_m$$.
                             In the model, $$b_i$$ will be defined as the asset value of $$a_i$$ and $$c_i$$ as the costs for applying $$I_j$$ for $$i=1,\ldots,m$$ and $$j=1,\ldots,n$$.

                         Security Investments for System 1 #slide 
                             Example for System 1: asset $$a$$ is a network with $$a_1$$ a firewall and $$a_2$$ an end-device (PC)
                             Assumption: there are no internal threats in the system.
                             Security inter-dependencies:
                                 If $$a_1$$ is secure, the overall system $$a$$ is secure (whether $$a_2$$ is secure or not, as it will not be compromised internally and is protected externally through $$a_1$$).
                                 If $$a_1$$ is not secure,  then $$a$$ is secure, as long as $$a_2$$ is secure.
                             We want to study the overall security achieved by the following security investments:
                                 $$I_1$$: Harden the firewall
                                 $$I_2$$: Patch the PC
                         Security Investments for System 2 #slide 
                             Example for System 2: a network consisting of two connected PCs $$a_1$$ and $$a_2$$.
                             They have different vulnerabilities and different asset values.
                             Security inter-dependencies:
                                 The system is secure, if both $$a_1$$ and $$a_2$$ are secure.
                                 But both assets are independent in terms of their security.
                             Study the security achieved by the following investments:
                                 $$I_1$$: Patch the PC $$a_1$$
                                 $$I_2$$: Patch the PC $$a_2$$
                         Multi-Asset Returns of (Single) Investment (M-ROI) #slide  #econ #security #VNM 
                             Let us consider an extension of the ROI concept to $$m$$ multiple assets, secured by the same investment.
                             Example for $$m=2$$: 
                                 Utility function for investment securing two assets:
                                     $$u(\lambda)= \begin{pmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \\  \end{pmatrix}-(\lambda+1)\begin{pmatrix} c_1 \\ c_2 \\ \end{pmatrix}\ge 0$$.
                                 This vector function does in general not have a value $$\rho$$ satisfying $$u(\rho)=\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\  \end{pmatrix}$$, so it is difficult to define ROI that way.
                         M-ROI Approach #slide 
                             Motivation: we could add the ROIs of the individual asset investments, but only if they are independent (see ALE for multiple assets)
                             Weighted asset selection vector $$x^\top = (x_1,x_2)$$ allows for distribution of allocated intensity:
                                 Denote $$\rho:=ROI(a_1,a_2)$$.
                                 Assume $$x^\top u(\rho)\ge 0$$ and solve for $$\rho$$.
                                 We require
                                     $$x^\top u(\rho)=x^\top\begin{pmatrix} b_1-c_1-\rho c_1 \\ b_2-c_2-\rho c_2 \end{pmatrix}\ge 0$$.
                                 This yields 
                                     $$ROI(a_1,a_2)=\rho \le \frac{x_1(b_1-c_1)+x_2(b_2-c_2)}{x_1c_1+x_2c_2}= \frac{x_1(b_1-c_1)}{x_1c_1+x_2c_2}+\frac{x_2(b_2-c_2)}{x_1c_1+x_2c_2}$$
                                     $$\le \frac{b_1-c_1}{c_1}+\frac{b_2-c_2}{c_2}=ROI(a_1)+ROI(a_2)$$.
                             Hence we could define 
                                 $$\rho:=\max \lambda$$  s.th. $$\exist x_1,x_2:x^\top u(\lambda)\ge 0$$.
                         Return of Multi-Investments (ROI-M) #slide 
                             This is an extension to $$n$$ multiple security investments made for the single asset.
                             Example for $$n=2$$: 
                                 Utility function for two investments, acting as overlapping controls
                                     $$u(\lambda)= \begin{pmatrix} b_1 & b_2 \\  \end{pmatrix}-(\lambda+1)\begin{pmatrix} c_1 & c_2 \\ \end{pmatrix}$$.
                         ROI-M Approach #slide 
                             There is a different parameters to optimise now:
                                 Weighted security control ("layered defense'') selection vector $$y = \begin{pmatrix} y_1 \\ y_2 \\  \end{pmatrix}$$.
                                 Minimise $$\lambda$$ over $$u(\lambda)y$$, the assignment of invested capital.
                                 Why? Consider the attacker's mind!
                             Economics context:
                                 Investment returns are produced goods.
                                 The production creates costs.
                                 These should be minimised.
                             Interpretation for security domain:
                                 Security investments can be done in several ways.
                                 The attacker wants them to be as ineffective as possible, potentially for a single (or small number of) assets.
                                 This creates maximal damage for the defending organisation.
                                 Hence the minimiser function can predict incoming attacks (principle of easiest attack).
                         Multi-Asset Returns of Multi-Investments (M-ROI-M) #slide 
                             Combine both extensions to model $$n$$ multiple investments made for each of the $$m$$ assets.
                             There are two parameters to optimise now:
                                 Maximise $$\lambda$$ over selection of covered assets
                                 Minimise $$\lambda$$ over assignment of security controls
                             One can show that these values are so-called equilibrium value of the Von Neumann economical growth model.
                         Generic M-ROI-M Model ($$m=2, n=2$$) #slide 
                             Asset selection vector $$x^\top = (x_1,x_2)$$.
                             Layered-defense vector ("security policy'') $$y = \begin{pmatrix} y_1 \\ y_2 \\ \end{pmatrix}$$.
                             Matrix ROI for asset consisting of two inter-dependent assets: 
                                 $$U(\lambda)= \lambda\begin{pmatrix} c_{11} & c_{12}\\ c_{21} & c_{22} \\ \end{pmatrix}-\begin{pmatrix} b_{11}-c_{11} & b_{12}-c_{12}\\ b_{21}-c_{21} & b_{22}-c_{22} \\ \end{pmatrix} =: \lambda C -B$$.
                             Definition of upper and lower ROI:
                                 $$\rho^+:=\max \lambda$$  s.th. $$\exist x:\,x^\top U(\lambda)\ge 0$$.
                                 $$\rho^-:=\min \lambda$$  s.th. $$\exist y:\,U(\lambda)y\ge 0$$.

                     Defender Cost #slide 
                         When an asset is attacked, there is damage/harm/loss, resulting in a cost
                         It might cost time and money to defend/repair an asset
                         There could also be other hidden costs
                         We will present a cost model, inspired by Anderson's taxonomy \cite{Anderson2013-nq} on the cost of cybercrime 
                         Approach: scaling up the notion of a "system": 
                             Society becomes organisation
                             People asset turns into a generic asset of organisation
                             Use of computers in society is mapped into business operations
                     Defender Cost Framework #slide 
                         We would like to quantify both tangible and intangible costs
                         Can distinguish between __direct __and__ indirect loss__ as well as __defence cost__
                             Direct losses:
                                 Replacing or repairing an asset
                             Indirect  losses:
                                 Loss of business
                                 Loss of reputation

                     Defender Benefit #slide 
                         We usually get some "operational benefit" from a digital asset
                             This could be revenues (in a business organisation)
                             Individuals get benefits for their leisure activities, e.g. improved communications and information sharing
                         Question: how can we quantify this?
                         It might be reasonable to assume that this is proportional to the asset value
                         Could then be used for the cost-benefit analysis

                                         Actor (origin of the threat)
                                             OCTAVE distinguishes between the actors "nature" and "human" 
                                         Motive (reason for the attack) 
                                             Attackers might be classified according to his/her motive: 
                                                 Amateurs 
                                                 Script Kiddies
                                                 Geeks
                                                 White Hat (Ethical) Hackers 
                                                 Grey Hat Hackers 
                                                 Black Hat Hackers (Computer Criminals) 
                                         Access (how the asset is reached)
                                             An attack vector is a path or means by which the attacker can gain access to an asset 
                                             Attack vectors enable the exploitation of system vulnerabilities, including the human element. 
                                             Examples: 
                                                 A web interface with an XSS vulnerability  
                                                 An employee with a weak password 
                                         Outcome (damage likely to be caused)
                                             Outcome is one of the following: disclosure, modification, loss/destruction, interruption, or other 
                                             It is measured by the impact on the organisation -- the overall cost of losing an asset 
                                         Mini-Exercises: Threat Profile 
                                             For this exercise, you will review the latest developments concerning the ENISA (EU/Brexit InfoSec) vulnerability and create a threat profile of the most critical asset, relevant in this scenario.
                                             Reminder: a threat profile consists of the following attributes:
                                                 Asset (e.g. customer data, pc,)
                                                 Access (e.g. private/public network, web page)
                                                 Actor (Source of threat)
                                                 Internal (e.g. staff), External (e.g. hacker)
                                                 Motive (accidental, deliberate)
                                                 Outcome (Impact of asset e.g. data loss)
                                             Solutions
                                                 Threat 1: interception of confidential data/info by EU-internal attacker.
                                                     Asset:
                                                         Data in transit between a EU country and the UK.
                                                             criminal records

                                                         Another member country of the EU
                                                     Motive (accidental, deliberate):
                                                         accidential
                                                     Outcome (disclosure, modification, loss/destruction, interruption, or other):
                                                         disclosure
                                                 Threat 2: interception of confidential data/info by attacker external to the EU-internal

                                 Phase 2: Identify infrastructure vulnerabilities 
                                     Process 5: Identify network access paths and IT components related to critical assets 
                                     Process 6: Evaluate identified IT components 
                                 Phase 3: Develop security strategy and mitigation plans 
                                     Process 7: Conduct risk analysis 
                                         Goal: to identify and evaluate the impact of threats to critical assets 
                                         OCTAVE forms a risk profile by expanding the threat profile by two additional attributes:
                                             Impact description -- "The disclosure of the sensitive documents mean that our competitors know our trade secrets and might be able to come out with a competitive new product."
                                             Impact value -- usually chosen from {low, medium, high}, looking at impact areas such as:
                                                 Reputation/customer confidence
                                                 Life/health of customer
                                                 Fines/Legal penalties
                                                 Financial
                                                 etc
                                         Mini-Exercises: Risk Profile 
                                             Consider the threat profile from the previous exercise and complete it to a risk profile. 
                                                 Impact description:
                                                     Act of terrorism, committed in the EU with one nationality, and travelling back to UK with another nationality-passport and hence he/she is not arrested at the border.
                                                 Impact value:
                                                     Potentially high.
                                         Criticism: this approach is quite rudimentary and does not fully implement a risk analysis as we have introduced earlier. 
                                     Process 8: Develop protection strategy and mitigation plan 
                                         Information generated by Phases 1 and 2 are analysed to:
                                             Identify risks to critical assets - prioritise
                                             Develop protection strategies
                                             Develop mitigation plans
                                             Propose next steps
                                         Will need Senior Management approval
                             OCTAVE-S -- organisations ≤ 300 employees
                                 Developed in 2003 in response to needs of smaller organisations
                                 Meets same OCTAVE criteria but is adapted to more limited means and unique constraints of small organizations
                                     Small organisation with a simple hierarchical structure
                                     Small interdisciplinary analysis team (3-5 employees)
                                 Uses more streamlined processes and different worksheets, but produces the same type of results
                                 Includes a limited exploration of the computing infrastructure during Phase 2
                             OCTAVE Allegro -- focuses on information assets
                                 What is OCTAVE Allegro?
                                     Developed in 2007 due to the increased need to protect data
                                     Derived from earlier OCTAVE and OCTAVE-S methodologies.
                                     Unlike previous OCTAVE approaches, it focuses on information assets:
                                         Where they are stored, transported, and processed
                                         How they are used
                                         How they are exposed to threats, vulnerabilities, and disruptions as a result
                                 Consists of eight steps organized into four phases:
                                     Develop risk measurement criteria consistent with the organization's mission, goal objectives, and critical success factors.
                                     Create a profile of each critical information asset that establishes clear boundaries for the asset, identifies its security requirements, and identifies all of its __containers__.
                                     Identify threats to each information asset in the context of its containers.
                                     Identify and analyse risks to information assets and begin to develop mitigation approaches.
                         Strengths
                             Well-documented through published academic papers and freely available resources
                             Flexible as organisations may choose to implement portions that they find appropriate
                             Comprehensive and thorough
                             Strategic as it focuses on important and relevant risks
                             “Cheap” as it is self-led
                         Shortcomings
                             Needs extensive preparation and is complex when done correctly
                             Qualitative methodology means that OCTAVE does not allow for the mathematical modelling of risks
                             Risk Analysis is simplistic as done on a single asset and does not use any mathematical model
                     STRIDE and DREAD -- a (web) application security risk analysis framework, developed for Microsoft's threat modelling framework
                         STRIDE and DREAD are threat classification models originally designed for web application security.
                             Developed by Microsoft in 2005
                             Now also recommended by OWASP
                             Is top-down: focuses on threats (“threat/risk modelling”)
                             A simple approach

                             STRIDE is part of the bigger picture of threat modelling.
                         The STRIDE mnemonic conveniently covers most relevant threats to CIA.

                         DREAD is a mnemonic that can be used for impact-assessing activity.
                             **D**amage -- how bad would an attack be?
                             **R**eproducibility -- how easy is it to reproduce the attack?
                             **E**xploitability -- how much work is it to launch the attack?
                             **A**ffected users -- how many people will be impacted?
                             **D**iscoverability -- how easy is it to discover the threat?
                         STRIDE proceeds in 4 steps.
                             Step 1. Create a list including all known threats, mapped against their impact.
                             Step 2. Rank threats by criticality (impact) and likelihood.
                                 For each threat, assign two numbers $$c$$ and $$l$$:
                                     $$c$$ -- criticality (10 is most severe)
                                     $$l$$ -- likelihood (10 is least likely to occur)
                                 Calculate overall risk as $$R = c/l$$.
                                 DREAD (and its successor alternatives) can be used to decide on criticality value $$c$$.
                                     When a given threat is assessed using DREAD, each category is given a rating. 
                                         Rating scales running from 0 to 10 are common -- for example, 10 for high, 5 for medium, 1 for low and 0 for none. 
                                         The sum of all ratings for a given exploit can be used to prioritize among different exploits.
                                     It was previously used at Microsoft and currently used by OpenStack and many other corporations but it was discovered that the ratings are not very consistent and subject to debate. 
                                     It was out of use at Microsoft by 2008.
                                     Discoverability Debate -- some security experts feel that including the "Discoverability" element as the last "D" rewards Security through Obscurity.
                                     Some organizations have either moved to a DREAD-D "DREAD minus D" scale (which omits Discoverability) or always assume that Discoverability is at its maximum rating.
                             Step 3. Select a mitigation technique or technology for each threat
                             Step 4. Start again (Step 1) as the project evolves
                         The main advantage of STRIDE is its simplicity and effectiveness.
                             STRIDE was originally designed for building secure web applications, whereas OCTAVE targets (information) security of an organisation.
                             Both frameworks are top-down, but the OCTAVE has a more formal approach for identifying critical assets and their vulnerabilities.
                             In OCTAVE, threat profiling is very generic, whereas the STRIDE acronym helps to identify relevant threat categories.
                             OCTAVE also lacks specific guidelines for risk analysis, STRIDE has developed the DREAD categorisation for threat outcomes.

                             Risk Assessment
                                 Risk assessment is the process of identifying, estimating, analysing and prioritizing information security risks within the context of the organizational risk frame.
                                 Definition of Risk
                                     Risk is a measure of the extent to which an entity is threatened by a potential circumstance or event, and is typically a function of: 
                                         (i) the adverse impacts that would arise if the circumstance or event occurs;
                                         (ii) the likelihood of occurrence. 
                                     Information security risks are those risks that arise from the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information or information systems
                                 Approaches
                                     Assessment approach (e.g., quantitative, qualitative, or semi-qualitative), specifying the range of values those risk factors can assume during the risk assessment and how combinations of risk factors are identified/analyzed so that values of those factors can be functionally combined to evaluate risk
                                     Analysis approach (e.g., threat-oriented, asset/impact-oriented, or vulnerability-oriented), describing how combinations of risk factors are identified/analyzed to ensure adequate coverage of the problem space at a consistent level of detail.

                                 Risk Assessment Stages and Purpose: 
                                     Risk Identification
                                         Identify critical assets
                                         Identify security requirements
                                         Identify threats and vulnerabilities
                                             threats to organizations (i.e., operations, assets, or individuals) or threats directed through organizations against other organizations or the Nation;
                                             vulnerabilities internal and external to organizations;
                                     Risk Analysis
                                         Assessing risk requires the careful analysis of threat and vulnerability information to determine both:
                                             the extent to which circumstances or events could adversely impact organizational operations (i.e., mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.
                                             the likelihood that such circumstances or events or harm will occur.
                                     Risk Evaluation
                             Risk Response
                                 Addresses how organisations respond to risk, determined through a previous risk assessment.
                                 Response needs to be consistent, organisation-wide in accordance with the organizational risk frame by:
                                     (i) developing alternative courses of action for responding to risk;
                                         Security planning
                                     (ii) evaluating the alternative courses of action;
                                         Evaluating controls
                                     (iii) determining appropriate courses of action consistent with organizational risk tolerance;
                                         Selecting controls 
                                     (iv) implementing risk responses based on selected courses of action.
                                         Implementing controls

                             Risk Monitoring
                                 Addresses how organizations monitor risk over time. 
                                 The purpose of the risk monitoring component is to:
                                     (i) determine the ongoing effectiveness of risk responses (consistent with the organizational risk frame);
                                     (ii) identify risk-impacting changes to organizational information systems and the environments in which the systems operate;
                                     (iii) verify that planned risk responses are implemented and information security requirements are satisfied.

                                 Otherwise, it is referred to as __singular__
                                 We have $$\deg(f) \le r$$.
                             Pencil Eigenvalues -- Definition #slide 
                                 The concept of eigenvalues can be generalised to regular matrix pencils as follows: 
                                     Consider the pairs $$(\beta,\alpha) \in \bar{K}\times\bar{K}$$ such that there exist $$0\neq y \in {\bar{K}}^n$$ verifying $$\beta Ay = \alpha By$$.
                                     Define the equivalence relation
                                         $$(\beta_1,\alpha_1) \sim (\beta_2,\alpha_2)\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad \beta_1\alpha_2 -  \beta_2\alpha_1 = 0$$.
                                     We define the __spectrum__ $$\rho(A,B)$$ as $$(\bar{K}\times\bar{K})/\sim$$, the set of equivalence classes of $$\sim$$.
                                     This is the set of above pairs $$(\beta,\alpha)$$ modulo the equivalence relation $$\sim$$.
                                     The eigenvalues of the regular matrix pencil $$A-\lambda B$$ will be identified with the elements of $$\rho(A,B)$$.
                             Finite and Infinite Eigenvalues #slide 
                                 The values
                                     $$\left\{ \left. \lambda = \frac{\alpha}{\beta} \;\right|\;[(\beta, \alpha)] \in \rho(A,B), \beta \neq 0 \right\}$$
                                 are the __finite eigenvalues__ of the matrix pencil $$A-\lambda B$$.
                                 If $$[(0, 1)] \in \rho(A,B)$$, it is a representative of the __eigenvalue at infinity__. 
                                 The finite eigenvalues can be identified with the roots of $$f(\lambda) = \det(A-\lambda B)$$.
                                 The algebraic multiplicity of a finite eigenvalue is its multiplicity as a root of $$f$$.
                                 The integer $$d=n-\deg(P)$$ is the multiplicity of the eigenvalue at infinity.
                                 If $$B=I$$, the finite eigenvalues are identified with the eigenvalues of $$A$$ in the usual sense. 
                                 In this case and more generally if $$\det B \neq 0$$, the multiplicity of the eigenvalue at infinity is zero.

                                     We denote the __spectrum__ of a regular matrix pencil, which may comprise of both finite eigenvalues and the eigenvalue at infinity, as $$\sigma(A-\lambda B)=\sigma^\circ(A-\lambda B)\cup\sigma^\infty(A-\lambda B)$$.
                                     (Generalised) eigenvalues: finite number of roots of $$f$$, and potentially infinity.

                                     Then $$\sigma(A-\lambda I) =: \sigma(A)$$ the set of eigenvalues of the matrix $$A$$.
                                     We say that the spectrum is of __finite__, __infinite__ or __mixed__ type depending on whether the eigenvalues are finite, infinite, or both.

                                     We will be interested in matrices of the form $$A-\lambda = ((a_{ij}-\lambda))$$. #paper:adv-learning 
                                     Our preferred notation for these will be matrix pencil representation of the form $$A-\lambda E$$ where $$E$$ is defined as previously. #paper:adv-learning 
                                     It can be seen that for matrix pencils of this special form, under the assumption of regularity, there exists at the most one generalised real eigenvalue, with one corresponding left and right generalised eigenvector. #paper:adv-learning I
                                     n this case, the collection $${\mathcal E}_{A}=(\lambda^*,x,y)$$ of the generalised eigenvalue (if it exists), left and right eigenvectors  will be referred to as the __generalised eigensystem__ associated with the regular matrix pencil $$A-\lambda E$$. #paper:order-2-barrier #paper:adv-learning 
                                     All eigenvectors are assumed to be normalised in order to correspond to mixed strategies #paper:order-2-barrier 
                                     In the remainder of the paper, we will simply refer to __eigenvalues__ and __eigenvectors__, consistently omitting the term "generalised".

                                 $$P$$-matrices arise in many fields such as economics, physics, and engineering.
                                 They are used in the study of linear complementarity problems, which are a class of optimization problems.
                                     The linear complementarity problem LCP(M,q) has a unique solution for every vector q if and only if M is a P-matrix.
                                 $$P$$-matrices are also used in the analysis of Markov chains, which are a stochastic model used in probability theory and statistical mechanics.
                                 In addition, $$P$$-matrices have applications in the study of partial differential equations and finite difference methods for solving them.

                             (ii) $$D = 0$$,

                     Motivation #slide #maths-engage
                         Mathematics is seen as a "tough" subject, hence the need for good educational resources 
                         Aims of this lecture:
                             to improve your "Maths Engagement",
                             to provide a new way of delivery basic maths knowledge,
                             to be useful to students of a range of technical courses.
                         Target audience: 
                             If you had some prior exposure to maths, but you feel "out of touch"
                             If you would like to gain a quick overview of mathematics, useful for computer security/cryptography
                         We cannot cover everything of course, you should consult a good textbook to deepen your engagement 
                     Mathematical Syntax #slide #maths-engage
                         Symbols form an important part of the language of mathematics: __syntax__
                         Main difficulty: use of Greek letters, special symbols and typesetting conventions
                         Variables: 
                             $$a,b,c,\ldots y,z$$
                             $$\alpha, \beta, \gamma,\ldots,\omega$$
                             $$\bar{a}, \tilde{a}, \hat{a}, a_i, \tilde{a}_{ij}, \ldots$$
                         Operators:
                             $$+,\;-,\;\times,\; \cdot,\; :,\; /$$
                         Advanced Operators:
                             $$\sum,\prod, \sqrt{\cdot}$$
                     The Language of Maths (Semantics) #slide #maths-engage
                         Maths is like a language that you need to learn and practice, in order to make sense of

                             Number system: a scheme to represent integers (or rationals) using digits
                             Traditionally humans have used the decimal system
                             Writing $$d$$ in a number system with basis $$b$$ means computing \[ d_{(b)} = d_{k}b^k + \ldots + d_{1}b + d_0 \quad (d_{i} \in \{0\ldots b-1\}) \]
                             Here $$b$$ is the __basis __and the $$d_i$$ the __digits__
                             Decimal system: $$b = 10$$
                             Binary: $$b = 2$$, hexadecimal: $$b = 16$$, ternary: $$b = 3$$
                             Can also represent fractions, using negative powers of $$b$$

                     Integer Arithmetic #slide #maths-engage
                         We again consider integer numbers
                         We can perform __addition__, __subtraction__, __multiplication __and __division with remainder__
                         Examples for division with remainder:
                             10:5 = 2 since 10 = 2*5 + 0 (remainder 0)
                             19:2 = 9 since 19 = 9*2 + 1 (remainder 1)
                             23:5 = 4 since 23 = 4*5 + 3 (remainder 3)
                         We say that $$a$$ is divisible by $$b$$ if the division of $$a$$ by $$b$$ gives remainder 0
                         In the above example, 10 is divisible by 5

                         The Modulo Operation -- Definition #slide #maths-engage
                             Introducing $$a \bmod n$$: the modulo operation is defined as remainder of division of $$a$$ by $$n$$.
                             Example calculations:
                                 $$19 \bmod 5 = 4$$
                                 $$10 \bmod 5 = 0$$
                                 $$19 \bmod 2 = 1$$
                                 $$23 \bmod 5 = 3$$
                             Real world scenario: we know that 25h is the same as 1h -- the clock is counted modulo 24!
                         The Modulo Operation -- Notations #slide #maths-engage
                             Unfortunately, over time mathematicians have adopted different notations
                             __Functional notation__: $$b=\bmod(a,n)$$
                             Example: The input $$a=15$$ and $$n=4$$ gives the output $$b=3$$
                             __Equational notation__: $$a \equiv b \pmod{n}$$ means $$a \bmod n = b \bmod n$$
                             __Lazy mathematician's notation__: simply write $$a \equiv b $$ $$(n)$$
                             Examples:
                                 $$15\equiv 11 \pmod{4}$$
                                 $$4 \equiv 19 \equiv 24 \equiv -1$$ $$(5)$$
                         The Modulo Operation -- Properties #slide #maths-engage
                             You can use the Calculator in Windows to evaluate the mod function
                             Small numbers can be done without a tool
                             Additional Properties:
                                 $$a \bmod n$$ is always smaller than $$n$$
                                 $$a \bmod n=a$$ if $$a &lt; n$$
                                 $$a+k\cdot n \bmod n\equiv a \bmod n$$ (useful if $$a$$ is negative)
                                 $$a \bmod n\equiv b \bmod n$$ is equivalent to saying $$n$$ divides $$a - b$$ (Mathematician's preferred definition)

                     Modular Arithmetic #eyo-style:Subsection  #h 
                         Modular Arithmetic #slide #maths-engage
                             We can perform addition, subtraction and multiplication modulo $$n$$
                             This confines results to range $$[0..n-1]$$ -- there is no "overflow"
                             Notation: $$a+b \bmod n$$ means $$(a+b) \bmod n$$
                             Similar for $$-$$ and $$\cdot$$, also use exponentiation (power raising)
                             Examples:
                                 $$7 + 5 = 2 \bmod 10$$
                                 Reason: $$7 + 5 = 12\;\;$$ and $$\;\;12 \bmod 10 = 2$$
                                 $$7\cdot 5 = 5 \bmod 10$$
                                 Reason: $$7 \cdot 5 = 35 \;\;$$ and $$\;\;35 \bmod 10 = 5$$
                                 $$7^5 = 16807 = 7 \bmod 10$$
                         Associativity of Modular Arithmetic #slide #maths-engage
                             An operation is __associative__, if brackets can be grouped freely (intermediate results can be computed in any order)
                             It is easy to see that normal addition, multiplication and exponentiation are associative: e.g. $$(1+3) + 4 = 1 + (3+4) = 8$$
                             This is correct for modular arithmetic as well!
                             Example: we want to compute $$(2^5)^2 \bmod 30$$.
                                 \begin{eqnarray*}(2^5 \bmod 30)^2 \bmod 30 & = & (32 \bmod 30)^2 \bmod 30 \\ & = & 2^2 \bmod 30 \\ & = & 4. \end{eqnarray*} #eyo-style:Normal

                             A table can be used to illustrate arithmetic -- the entry in position $$(i,j)$$ is assigned to $$\;i+j \bmod n\;$$ (or $$\;i*j \bmod n)$$

                             Invented by George Boole (1854)
                             Idea: introduce operations on truth values. This maps logics into algebra.
                             The main logical operators are illustrated using the following __truth table__:
                             $$\begin{array}{| c |c|| c | c | c || c | c | c |} \hline x & y & \neg \; x & x \;\wedge\; y & x \;\lor\; y & x \oplus y & x \Rightarrow y & x \Leftrightarrow y \\ \hline 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}$$ #eyo-style:Normal 
                             Example for $$\Rightarrow$$: $$x=$$ "It is raining."; $$y=$$ "The ground is wet".

                             Definition: given two integers $$a$$ and $$b$$, their __greatest common divisor__ $$\gcd(a, b)$$ is the greatest integer dividing both $$a$$ and $$b$$.
                             Example: $$a = 28, \; b = 24 \Rightarrow \gcd(28, 24) = 4$$.
                             The gcd can be computed e.g. using prime factor decomposition: let $$a = p_1^{\alpha_1} \cdots p_n^{\alpha_n}$$ and $$b = p_1^{\beta_1} \cdots p_n^{\beta_n}$$ with $$\alpha_i, \beta_i\ge 0, p_i$$ prime.
                             It follows that then $$\gcd(a,b) = \prod p_i^{\min(\alpha_i,\beta_i)}$$.
                             We say that $$a$$ and $$b$$ are __co-prime__ if $$\gcd(a,b) = 1$$.
                         The Euclidean Algorithm #slide #maths-engage 
                             The __Euclidean Algorithm__ (EA) computes the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
                             Based on following __recursive__ identity:\[\gcd(a,b) = \gcd(b, a \bmod b)\]and $$\gcd(a, 0) = a$$ (__base case__). #fix 
                             We explain this using an example -- compute $$\gcd(80,45)$$:
                                 $$80: \color{orange}{45}  = 1$$ and $$80 - 1* \color{orange}{45}  =  \color{blue}{35}$$
                                 $$\color{orange}{45} : \color{blue}{35} = 1$$ and $$\color{orange}{45} - 1* \color{blue}{35} =  \color{green}{10}$$
                                 $$\color{blue}{35}:\color{green}{10} = 3$$ and $$\color{blue}{35} - 3* \color{green}{10} =\color{red}{5}$$
                                 $$\color{green}{10} : \color{red}{5} = 2$$ and $$\color{green}{10} - 2* \color{red}{5} = \color{yellow}{0}\Rightarrow$$ algorithm terminates!
                             Solution: $$\gcd(80, 45) = \color{red}{5}$$
                             Reason: $$\gcd(80, 45)=\gcd(45, 35)=\cdots =\gcd(5, 0)=5$$.

                             Let $$a$$, $$n$$ be integers. The __inverse __of $$a$$ modulo $$n$$ is an integer $$x$$ such that $$a\cdot x \equiv 1 \bmod n$$.
                             Of course, then also $$x\cdot a \equiv 1 \bmod n$$.
                             We also write $$a^{-1} \bmod n$$ for the inverse.
                             Example:
                                 $$a = 3$$, $$n = 20$$.
                                 The inverse of $$a$$ modulo $$20$$ is $$x = 7$$ since $$3\cdot 7 = 21 \equiv 1 \bmod 20$$.
                                 Of course, also $$7\cdot 3 \equiv 1 \bmod 20$$.
                             Note: the inverse does not always exist. In fact, the inverse of $$a$$ exists $$\Longleftrightarrow \gcd(a,n)=1$$.

                                 Extended Euclidean Algorithm
                             Using the extended version of Euclidean Algorithm (EEA):
                                 This computes $$u, v$$ such that $$ua + vb = \gcd(a, b)$$.
                                 If $$\gcd(a, b)=1$$: computes $$u$$ as modular inverse of $$a$$ mod $$b$$
                                 Proof: $$ua = 1-vb$$ so $$ua \equiv 1 \mod b$$
                             Example: 
                                 $$a = 3$$, $$b=20$$. 
                                 EEA computes $$u=7$$, $$v=-1$$ with $$7 \cdot 3 - 1 \cdot 20 = 1$$
                                 Hence: $$3^{-1} \equiv 7 \bmod{20}$$

                                 $$5:2 = 2$$ and $$5 \color{green}{- 2} * 2 = 1$$
                             Step 2 (Extended Euclidean Algorithm) -- redo EA operations on input (0, 1):
                                 $$0\color{red}{-1}*1 = -1$$

                         Number theory studies properties of the integers.
                         Founded by famous mathematicians such as Fermat, Gauss and Euler.
                         "Mathematics is the queen of the sciences, and number theory is the queen of mathematics" (Gauss).
                         Surprisingly difficult to prove even simple mathematical properties.
                         Believed to be without serious applications, before the invention of public key cryptography.
                         Our main interest: use of computational number theory for the RSA algorithm.
                     Prime Numbers #slide #maths-engage
                         Definition: __a prime number is any integer > 1 that is divisible only by itself and 1.__
                         Examples: $$2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 47, 1997, \ldots$$
                         It is easy to see that there is an infinite number of prime numbers. #blue 
                         Computers can decide relatively efficiently whether a given number is a prime number.
                         Integers that are not primes can be decomposed into smaller integers -- for example: $$12 = 4 \cdot 3$$
                         __Factorisation __of an integer: writing a given integer as product of prime numbers.
                             Every non-zero integer can be written __uniquely__ (up to sign) as product of prime numbers
                             Example: $$10 = 2\cdot 5,\;\; 12 = 2\cdot 2\cdot 3,\;\; 19 = 19$$
                         The problem of prime factorisation turns out to be a computationally very difficult problem.

                     Euler's Function #slide #maths
                         Euler's function $$\phi(n)$$ plays an important role in computational number theory
                         Many properties and theorems relating to integers can be stated, involving this function.
                         Our main interest: use for the proof of correctness of the RSA algorithm.
                         For $$n > 1$$, $$\phi(n)$$ is the number of integers $$k \in \{ 1,\ldots, n-1 \}$$ that are co-prime to $$n$$
                         So, formally: 
                             $$ \phi(n) := \;\mid \{ k \in \{ 1,.., n-1 \} : \gcd(k, n) = 1 \} \mid. $$ #eyo-style:Normal

                     Fermat's Little Theorem and Euler's Theorem #slide #maths
                         These two related theorems state properties of repeated multiplication, when using modular arithmetic.
                         Fermat's Little Theorem: __if $$p$$ is prime and $$p \nmid a$$, then $$a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \: (\bmod p)$$__.
                         Application in cryptography:
                             Primality testing
                             Integer factorisation
                         Euler's Theorem: __if $$\gcd(a,n) = 1$$ then $$a^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \: (\bmod n)$$__.

                         Verify Euler's Theorem for $$n=15$$ and $$a=2$$.
                         How are Euler's and Fermat's Theorem related? Hint: what is $$\phi(p)$$ for $$p$$ prime?
                         Prove that for $$p$$, $$q$$ prime and $$p \nmid a$$, $$q \nmid a$$, one has $$ a^{(p-1)(q-1)} \equiv 1 \pmod {pq}. $$ Hint: Use Euler's theorem and the fact that $$\phi(nm) = \phi(n) \phi(m)$$.
                     Solutions: Verify Euler's Theorem #slide
                         Euler's Theorem states that if $$\gcd(a,n) = 1$$ then $$a^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \: (\bmod n)$$.  
                         Here, with $$n=15$$ and $$a=2$$, $$\gcd(2,15) = 1$$, as they have no larger common divisors.  
                         We saw in the solution to Mini-Exercise 11 that $$\phi(15) = 8$$.  
                         Now  $$2^8 = 256$$ and $$256 = 17 \times 15 + 1$$, so $$2^{\phi(15)} \equiv 1 \: (\bmod 15)$$ and Euler's Theorem is verified for these two values.
                     Solutions: Euler's Theorem and Fermat's Theorem #slide
                         Consider integers $$a, p$$ with $$p$$ prime and $$p \nmid a$$.  
                         Then by Fermat's Little Theorem, $$a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \: (\bmod p)$$.  
                         Because $$p$$ is prime and $$p \nmid a$$ it must also be the case that $$\gcd(a,p) = 1$$.      What is $$\phi(p)$$?  Because for every positive integer $$m < p$$, $$\gcd(m,p) = 1$$, we must have $$\phi(p) = p - 1$$.  
                         Substituting $$\phi(p)$$ for $$p - 1$$ in the expression in Fermat's Little Theorem gives us $$a^{\phi(p)} \equiv 1 \: (\bmod p)$$, which is the expression in Euler's Theorem.  % EP bug
                     Solutions: cont. #slide
                         For $$p$$, $$q$$ prime and $$p \nmid a$$, $$q \nmid a$$,  $$ a^{(p-1)(q-1)} \equiv 1 \pmod {pq}$$
                         Recall from the last answer, we had $$\phi(p) = p-1$$.
                         So we can rewrite $$ a^{(p-1)(q-1)} = a^{\phi(p)\phi(q)} = a^{\phi(pq)}$$ using the hint.
                         Now $$\gcd(a, pq) = 1$$ because $$p \nmid a$$ and $$q \nmid a$$, so by Euler's Theorem, $$a^{\phi(pq)} \equiv 1 \pmod {pq}$$ as required.

                         In particular, one player has incomplete information about the other player.
                         Can be modelled by introducing Nature (a random value -- signal) as a player in the game 
                         This converts a game of incomplete information to a game of imperfect information

                     Basic Concepts #slide 
                         Bayesian are methods in probability and statistics named after Thomas Bayes. These methods include Bayesian Games which provides a new way for analysing incomplete information games. In such games, there is a certain belief with a known probability distribution
                         John Harsanyi developed a new theory for analysing games: Bayesian Games
                             "developing the highly innovative analysis of games of incomplete information, so-called Bayesian games"
                     Bayesian game consists of: #slide 
                         finite set N (the set of players)
                             each player has his own set of actions
                             each player has a finite set of signals and a signal function
                             each player has a prior belief
                             each player has a preference relation
                         finite set set of $$\Omega$$ (the set of states)
                         Bayesian Games (Games of Incomplete information) represents players' uncertainties about the game player
                     Bayesian Game -- Definition #slide
                         A Bayesian game can be represented as a tuple $$(N, A,\Theta, p, u)$$ where:
                             $$N$$ is a set of agents
                             $$A = A_1 \times\cdots \times A_n$$ where $$A_i$$ is the set of actions available to player $$i$$
                             $$\Theta = \Theta_1 \times\cdots \times \Theta_n$$ where $$\Theta_i$$ is the type space of player $$i$$
                             $$p : \Theta \rightarrow [0, 1]$$ is a common prior over types
                             $$u = (u_1, \cdots , u_n)$$, where $$u_i : A \times \Theta \rightarrow \R$$ is the utility function for player $$i$$
                     Two-Player Bayesian Game -- Definition #slide
                         A Two-Player Bayesian game can be represented as $$G(A,B, \Theta, p)$$ where:
                             $$\Theta$$ is the type space of the first player
                             $$A = A_1 \times\cdots \times A_n$$ where $$A_i$$ is the set of actions available to player $$i$$
                             $$u = (u_1, \cdots , u_n)$$, where $$u_i : A \times \Theta \rightarrow \R$$ is the utility function for player $$i$$
                             $$p : \Theta \rightarrow [0, 1]$$ is a common prior over types
                     Harsanyi-Transformation #slide 
                         John Harsanyi developed a theory for analysing Bayesian Games. 
                         Idea: convert game with uncertainty over strategies (types) into game with payoff uncertainty. 
                         Assume knowledge of probability distribution for types. 
                         This transforms a game of incomplete information into one of imperfect information. 
                         This can then solved with standard techniques. 
                         Disadvantage: the resulting game is of bigger size and hence more difficult to analyse.
                     Bayesian Nash Equilibrium (BNE) Types #slide 
                         __Pooling Equilibrium__: if the first player's best response is independent of any type. It remains the same, regardless of his belief in the type of Player 2.
                         __Separating Equilibrium__: if best response is different, depending on the type.

                                     If Player 1's mixed strategy $$x^*$$ is a best response to the (mixed) strategy $$y$$ of the other player, then, for each pure strategy $$e_i$$ such that $$x_i > 0$$, it must be the case that $$e_i$$ is itself a best response.  In particular, the payoff $$e_i Ay$$ must be the same for all such strategies.
                                 Note: an analogous lemma can be stated for Player 2, $$y^*$$ and $$x$$.
                             Proof (I) #slide #CYENS 
                                 Recap: due to $$x^* \in \mathcal{BR}(y^*)$$ we have $${}^t \!x^*Ay^*=v_{A}$$ and $${}^t \!xAy^*\le v_{A}$$ for all $$x$$. 
                                 Let us write $${}^t \!x^*= (x^*_{1},\ldots ,x^*_{i},\ldots ,x^*_{n})$$ and assume $$x^*_{i}\neq 0$$.
                                 Furthermore, denote $${}^t \!e_{i}= (\underbrace{0,\ldots ,0}_{i-1}, 1, 0,\ldots , 0)$$.
                                 It is clear that $${}^t \!e_{i}Ay^*\le v_{A}$$.
                             Proof (II) #slide #CYENS 
                                 Now assume $${}^t \!e_{i}Ay^*< v_{A}$$, minimal for all pure strategies. 
                                 Find $$j\neq i$$, $$x_{j}^*\neq 0$$ (such $$j$$ exists since $$x^*$$ is not pure) and define
                                     $${}^t \!\hat{x}={}^t \!x^*-x_i^* {\;}^t\! e_i+x_i^* {\;}^t\! e_j=(x^*_{1},\ldots ,0,\ldots ,x^*_{j}+x^*_{i},\ldots ,x^*_{n})$$.
                                 This is a mixed strategy as all components of strategy vector still add up to one.
                                 It follows
                                     $$^t\!\hat{x}Ay^*={}^t\!x^*Ay^*+x_{i}^*\overbrace{(^t\!e_{j}Ay^*-{}^t\!e_{i}Ay^*)}^{>0}>\,{}^t\! x^*Ay^*$$
                                 which is a contradiction. Hence we must have $${}^t \!e_{i}Ay^*= v_{A}$$. 
                                 An additional consequence is $${}^t \!x^*Ay^*\le v_{A}{}^t\!e$$. 
                                 Furthermore, since $${}^t \!e_{i}A$$ is the $$i$$th row of $$A$$,
                                     $$Ay^*= v_{A}e$$.

                             Sometimes, two different games have the same strategic constraints 
                             This might not be directly obvious from the payoff functions 
                             But it can be seen from the relationship that exists between the two game matrices
                             This means that the Nash solution strategies coincide
                             But not necessarily the values
                             This is formalised with the concept of strategic equivalence

                             This means $$S\in \mathcal{B}(I)\Longleftrightarrow S={\rm diag}(\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_m)\cdot E$$.

                             Assume the games $$G=G(A,B)$$ and $$\tilde{G}=G(\tilde{A},\tilde{B})$$ are strategically equivalent. Then any strategy profile $$s$$ is a Nash Equilibrium profile for $$G$$, iff it is one for $$\tilde{G}$$. 
                         Proof #slide 
                             One shows that best responses for any strategy coincide for both games. 
                             Let $$x^*\in {\mathcal{BR}}_G(y)$$ be a best response for $$y$$ in the game $$G$$. 
                             Hence $$x^*Ay\ge xAy$$ for all strategies $$x$$. 
                             But then
                                 $$x^*\tilde{A}y=x^*Ay+(\alpha_1,\alpha_2)y\ge xAy+(\alpha_1,\alpha_2)y=x\tilde{A}y\quad \forall x$$.
                             Thus $$x^*\in {\mathcal{BR}}_{\tilde{G}(y)}$$. 
                             Similarly for $$y^*\in {\mathcal{BR}}_G(x)$$.

                                 Consider the following generic bimatrix game in strategic normal form:
                                     $$\begin{array}{c|c|c}  &l &r \\ \hline u & a_{1}, a_{2} & b_{1}, b_{2} \\  \hline d &c_{1}, c_{2}& d_1,d_2  \end{array}$$
                                 To check the existence of a completely mixed-strategy equilibrium, we use a fundamental theorem due to Nash.
                             Best Response to (Row) Player 1 #slide #CYENS
                                 Suppose the row player plays $$u$$ with probability $$\alpha$$ and $$d$$ with probability $$1-\alpha$$.
                                 He uses a mixed strategy $$\sigma=\alpha u+(1-\alpha)d$$.
                                 Then, if the column player uses both $$l$$ and $$r$$ in the mixed equilibrium best response, we have seen (Best Response Lemma) that they must both have the same payoff $$v_B$$.
                                 The payoff to $$l$$ against $$\sigma$$ is $$\alpha{a_2}+(1-\alpha)c_{2}$$, and the payoff to $$r$$ against $$\sigma$$ is $$\alpha b_{2}+(1-\alpha)d_2$$. 
                                 Equating these two, we find $$\alpha=\dfrac{d_2-c_2}{d_2-b_2+a_2-c_2}$$.

                                 This follows sthe same reasoning, assuming the column player uses the strategy $$\tau=\beta l +(1-\beta)r$$ (that is, plays $$l$$ with probability $$\beta$$). 
                                 Then, if the row player uses both $$u$$ and $$d$$, they must both have the same payoff against $$\beta$$. 
                                 The payoff to $$u$$ against $$\beta$$ is $$\beta a_{1} +(1-\sigma)b_{1}$$, and the payoff to $$d$$ against $$\sigma$$ is $$\beta c_{1}+ (1 -\beta)d_1$$. 
                                 Eventually we find 
                                     $$\beta=\dfrac{d_1-b_1}{d_1-b_1+a_1-c_1}.$$

                                 For this to make sense, the denominator must be nonzero, and the right-hand side must lie between zero and one. 
                                 Note that the __column__ player’s strategy is determined by the requirement that __row__ player’s two strategies be equal.

                             These are two-person, zero-sum finite games $$G=(X,Y,A)$$ where 
                                 $$X$$ and $$Y$$ are the sets of strategies for the different players 
                                 $$A:X\times Y \mapsto {\mathbb R}$$ is the payoff function. 
                             We use a matrix to represent the payoff function

                             We denote 
                                 $$v^{-}(A):=\max_x \min_y xAy$$ the __lower value__ of the matrix game $$G(A)$$. 
                                 $$v^{+}(A):= \min_y \max_x xAy $$ the __upper value__ of the game. 
                             Using elementary mathematics, it can be seen that $$v^{-} \le v^{+}$$.
                             Min-max Theorem (due to von Neumann): 
                                 In the setting of a matrix game, these two values can be seen to be the same: $$v^- = {v^+}$$.
                                 Proof: non-trivial. 
                         Value and Optimal Solutions #slide #deconstruct:equilibrium 
                             We can hence define the __value__ of the game uniquely by $$v(A):=\max_x \min_y xAy = \min_y \max_x xAy $$.
                             Any strategy $$x^*, y^*$$ satisfying $$x^*Ay^* = v$$ is called __optimal__. 
                             There may be several such $$x^*, y^*$$.
                             They are a __mutual best response__ pairs.

                             Often, NE are not mentioned in the context of zero-sum games.
                             We say that $$(x^*, y^*)$$ is a NE strategy profile iff
                                 $$\forall x: \; xAy^* \le x^*Ay^* = v^-$$ 
                                 $$\forall y: \; x^* Ay \ge x^*Ay^* = v^+$$ 
                             Note that one can show for zero-sum games that any combination of different optimal strategies yields an equilibrium strategy. 
                         Best Response #slide
                             Any player will want to maximise their payoff, which means 
                                 maximising $$xA$$ if $$x$$ is Player 1's strategy,
                                 minimising $$Ay$$ if $$y$$ is Player 2's strategy. 
                             With their best response, a player will want to maximise what she gets from the other player's move.
                                 The best response for Player 1 is to assume maximum damage caused by the other player, and then to try mitigating this as much as possible: $$ \max_x \min_y xAy =: v^{-}$$. 
                                 The best response for Player 2 is to assume Player 1 seeks maximum gain, and then to limit this as much as possible: $$\min_y \max_x xAy =: v^{+}$$.

                             Lemma. #lemma 
                                 If $$x^*$$ is an optimal solution for Player 1 and $$x^*_{i}>0$$ (i.e. $$i$$ is an active strategy), then every optimal solution $$y^*$$ for Player 2 satisfies
                                 $$(\underbrace{0,\ldots,0}_{i-1},1,\underbrace{0,\ldots,0}_{n-i-1}) Ay^*=\text{row}_{i}(A)y^* = v^-$$.
                                 For any other index $$k$$ with $$x_k^*=0$$ one has $$\text{row}_{k}(A)y^* < v^-$$.
                             Hence we have $$Ay^*=v^-e-b$$ where $$b\ge 0$$.

                             A similar statement holds for an optimal solution $$y^*$$ for Player 2. 
                             Lemma. #lemma 
                                 If $$y^*$$ is an optimal solution for Player 2 and $$y_{i}>0$$ (i.e. $$j$$ is an active strategy), then every optimal solution $$x^*$$ for Player 1 satisfies
                                 $$x^*A(\underbrace{0,\ldots,0}_{j-1},1,\underbrace{0,\ldots,0}_{m-j-1}) =x^*\text{col}_{j}(A) = v^+$$.
                                 For any other index $$k$$ with $$x_k^*=0$$ one has $$x^*\text{col}_{k}(A) > v^+$$.
                             Hence we have $$x^*A=v^+e+b$$ where $$b\ge 0$$.

                             Similar for $$ \min_y \max_x xAy $$.

                             Let P be an n-rowed matrix whose columns are nonzero vectors in real Euclidean m-space, R m. 
                             Tbe set of all nonnegative linear combinations of the columns of P is a cone which is called a polyhedral (or finitely generated) cone. 
                             The matrix P is called a generating matrix for the cone. 
                             A positive operator on a cone is a linear transformation which maps the cone into itself. 
                             Motivation #slide 
                                 It turns out that a natural setting for properties such as those stated in the last two theorems is that of regular matrix pencils, their associated (generalised) eigenvalues and eigenvectors. 
                                 expressed as generalised eigenvectors of an associated regular matrix pencil.  
                                 A zero-sum matrix game can be directly solved if $$\deg(\det A - \lambda E) > 0$$, i.e. the matrix polynomial vanishes identically in $$\lambda$$. 
                                 The following theorem generalises Shapley's theorem as it is also valid for $$v=0$$ and at the same time it improves Weil's theorem as it characterises the value of the same game (rather than a different one).

                                 Using a renaming of strategies, we can achieve that
                                     The rows of $$A$$ are ordered in (not necessarily strictly) decreasing value of their min-values
                                     We say that $$A$$ has ordered maximin profile
                                 Equally, we can arrange that
                                     The columns are of increasing max-values
                                     This is an ordered minimax profile

                                 We can even arrange for both profiles to be ordered simultaneously 
                                 In particular, if the maximin value equals the minimax, this then implies that the element at the top left equals the value $$v$$ of the game.

                                         The results of \cite{@Weil1968} and \cite{ShapleySnow1950} [#todo @luluwah Find citation], applicable to matrix games, were the initial inspiration for the work in this Section and Theorem \ref{} is a generalisation. Theorem \ref{} then extends this to bimatrix games. The work in \cite{bimatrix}, although not using the concept of matrix pencils, #todo

                                 Starting point of our investigation was the observation that there are sufficient condition for the existence of optimal strategies and value of zero-sum games, expressed in terms of algebraic properties of the game matrix $$A$$.  %

Then the game with matrix $$A$$ has value $$v(A)=v=1/e^\top A^{-1}e$$ and optimal strategies $$x=ve^\top A^{-1}$$ and $$y=vA^{-1}e$$, provided both $$x$$ and $$y$$ are nonnegative. #theorem

                             #definition A square matrix game $$G(A)$$ is called  __regular__ iff $$P(\lambda):=A-\lambda E$$ is a regular matrix pencil.
                             We denote $$c(\lambda)=\det(A-\lambda E)\not\equiv 0$$ the __characteristic polynomial__. 
                             If $$c(\mu)=0$$, $$\mu$$ is an eigenvalue corresponding to left and right eigenvectors $$x_\mu$$ and $$y_\mu$$ of $$P_A$$.
                             We also say that $$\mu$$ is the eigenvalue of the game. 
                             Note: we can have $$\mu=\infty$$.
                             Question: how does the value of the game $$v(A)$$ relate to $$\mu$$?

                         Simple type of a dynamic Bayesian game. 
                         It is a game with two players, called the sender and the receiver: 
                             The sender can have one of several types. The sender's type $$t$$, determines the payoff function of the sender. It is the private information of the sender - it is not known to the receiver.
                             The receiver has only a single type, so by the assumption of common priors, their payoff function is known to both players.
                     Game Play #slide 
                         The game has two steps:
                             The sender plays in the first step. They can play one of several actions, which are called __messages__. The set of possible messages is $$\mathcal M = \{m_1, m_2, m_3,\ldots, m_j\}$$.
                             The receiver plays in the second step, after viewing the sender's message. The set of possible actions is $$\mathcal A= \{a_1, a_2, a_3,\ldots, a_j\}$$.
                         The two players receive payoffs dependent on the sender's type, the message chosen by the sender and the action chosen by the receiver
                 Stackelberg Games #h 
                     In a Stackelberg game, one player (the “leader”) moves first, and all other players (the “followers”) move after him.
                     Stackelberg competition
                         Two firms (N = 2)
                         Each firm chooses a quantity sn ≥ 0
                         Cost of producing sn : cn sn
                         Demand curve:
                             Price=P(s1 +s2)=a–b(s1 +s2) • Payoffs:
                             Profit=Πn(s1,s2)=P(s1 +s2)sn –cn sn
                                 Stackelberg competition
                         In Stackelberg competition, firm 1 moves before firm 2.
                         Firm 2 observes firm 1’s quantity choice s1, then chooses s2.
                     Stackelberg competition
                         We solve the game using backward induction.
                         Start with second stage: Given s1, firm 2 chooses s2 as
                         s2 = arg maxs2 ∈ S2 Π2(s1, s2)
                         But this is just the best response R2(s1)!
                         
                             Best response for firm 2
                         Recall the best response given s1:
                         Differentiate and solve: So:
                         
                             Firm 1’s decision
                         Backward induction:
                         Maximize firm 1’s decision, accounting for
                         firm 2’s response at stage 2.
                         Thus firm 1 chooses s1 as
                         s1 = arg maxs1 ∈ S1 Π1(s1, R2(s1))
                         
                             Firm 1’s decision
                         Define tn = (a - cn)/b.
                         If s1 ≤ t2, then payoff to firm 1 is:
                         If s1 > t2, then payoff to firm 1 is:
                         
                             Firm 1’s decision
                         For simplicity, we assume that 2c2 ≤a+c1
                         This assumption ensures that
                         is strictly decreasing for s1 > t2.
                         Thus firm 1’s optimal s1 must lie in [0, t2].
                         
                             Firm 1’s decision
                         If s1 ≤ t2, then payoff to firm 1 is:
                         
                             Firm 1’s decision
                         If s1 ≤ t2, then payoff to firm 1 is:
                         
                             Firm 1’s decision
                         If s1 ≤ t2, then payoff to firm 1 is:
                         Thus optimal s1 is:
                     Stackelberg equilibrium
                         So what is the Stackelberg equilibrium?
                         Must give complete strategies: s1* = (a - 2c1 + c2)/2b
                         s2*(s1) = (t2/2 - s1/2)+
                         The equilibrium outcome is that
                         firm 1 plays s1*, and firm 2 plays s2*(s1*).
                     Comparison to Cournot
                         Assume c1 = c2 = c.
                         In Cournot equilibrium:
                         (1)s1 =s2 =t/3.
                         (2) Π1 = Π2 = (a - c)2/(9b). In Stackelberg equilibrium:
                         (1) s1 = t/2, s2 = t/4.
                         (2) Π1 = (a - c)2/(8b), Π2 = (a - c)2/(16b)
                     Comparison to Cournot
                         So in Stackelberg competition:
                         -the leader has higher profits
                         -the follower has lower profits
                         This is called a first mover advantage.
                         
                             Stackelberg competition: moral
                         Moral:
                         Additional information available can lower a player’s payoff,
                         if it is common knowledge that the player will have the additional information.
                         (Here: firm 1 takes advantage of knowing firm 2 knows s1.)

                             Multiple agents interact with each other in a shared environment
                             Actions affect not only the immediate reward but also the state of the environment, which influences future rewards.
                             New state does not depend on previous history though

                             Like in an MDP, the state of a Markov game satisfies the Markov property, meaning that the current state captures all relevant information about the past history of the game. However, in a Markov game, each agent's action affects not only the immediate reward but also the transition function, which determines the probability distribution over the next state given the current state and joint actions of all agents.

                             In these games, the players are not rational decision-makers, but instead follow simple rules that determine their behavior. 
                             The outcome of the game is determined by the frequency of each player's behavior in the population.

                         Stochastic Differential Games #slide 
                             These games are a more general form of stochastic games in which the state space evolves continuously over time, 
                             and the outcome of the game depends on the players' actions and the stochastic differential equations that govern the evolution of the state space.

                                 Maps:
                                     Payoff map $$G: \mathcal{P} \times  \mathcal{S} \rightarrow \R$$ is the same irrespective of current state
                                     State transition map $$T: \mathcal{P} \times  \mathcal{S} \times S \rightarrow {S}$$ depends linearly on chosen strategy and given state, hence a bilinear map
                             Description #slide 
                                 The same game $$G$$ proceeds in steps according to transition probabilities $$0\le s_{ij}\le 1$$
                                 If row player choose a strategy $$i$$ and column player chooses $$j$$, then 
                                     the game stops with probability $$s_{ij}$$
                                     the game continues with probability $$1-s_{ij}$$
                                 The state transition function is linearly depending on both players' strategies 
                                 Hence it is a function bilinear in the strategies
                             States and Transitions #slide 
                                 There are two states: play and stop.
                                 One is transient, the other absorbing.
                                 Transition matrix $$P$$ is encoding map 
                                     $$T: \mathcal{X}\times S \times \mathcal{Y} \rightarrow S$$, $$(x^\top,s,y) \mapsto T(x^\top,s,y):=x^\top Py$$.

                                 Define $$s=\min_{i,j} s_{ij}$$
                                 Hence, probability that game does not stop after $$t$$ steps is $$P(\text{"More than t steps"})\le (1-s)^t$$
                                 So game finishes in finite number of steps
                                 Payoffs accumulate throughout game
                                 Defining the bound $$M=\max | a_{ij} |$$ we find a bound for the expected payoff as
                                     $$M + (1-s)M + (1-s)^2M + \cdots = M/s$$.

                                 Assume we play the same strategy $$(x^\top, y)$$ and repeat with probability $$p=x^\top P y$$
                                 The probability that the state after $$k$$ iterations is still "play" is $$p^k$$
                                 The probability that the game stops in the $$k$$th iteration is $$p^{k-1}(1-p)$$
                                 The overall payoff is $$u=\sum_i x^\top A yp^i$$
                                 $$v=\sum_i x^\top P^i y$$
                                 The strategy leading to this is $$(x^\top P^k, P^ky)$$

                                     An [extensive form game](https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/mobile-html/Extensive_form_game) that consists of a number of repetitions of some base game (called a stage game). 
                                     The stage game is usually one of the well-studied [2-person games](https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/mobile-html/List_of_games_in_game_theory). 
                                     Repeated games capture the idea that a player will have to take into account the impact of his or her current action on the future actions of other players; this impact is sometimes called his or her reputation.  
                                     Single stage game or single shot game are names for non-repeated games.

                                         We now look at repeatedly playing these games $$G_1$$ and $$G_2$$. 
                                         We will define some stopping conditions to prevent an infinite duration. 
                                         This yields __stochastic games__, as introduced by (Shapley, 1953). 
                                         Let us focus on repeating $$G_1$$ first. 
                                     The Stochastic Game  $$G^*_1$$ #slide
                                         Consider the stopping matrix $$S=\begin{pmatrix} 1& s\\ s &1  \\  \end{pmatrix}$$ where $$0<s < 1$$. 
                                         There will be a finite sequence $$i=1,\ldots,N$$ of the __stage-game__ $$G^*_1$$. 
                                         The players decide on their strategies $$x_i$$ and $$y_i$$
                                         The payoffs of each stage are added
                                         After a stage, the game stops if:
                                             The system can trust a cooperative Wizard
                                             The system detects a non-cooperative Wizard
                                         Otherwise, it continues with probability $$1-s$$

                                     Previous Work #slide 
                                         Shapley has shown that in the case of a matrix game (zero-sum, $$B=-A$$), there is a unique value $$v$$.
                                         One can obtain this from a rational form $$v := \min_x \max_y \frac{xAy}{xSy}$$.
                                         (Von Neumann, 1937) and (Loomis, 1946) have first shown the existence and uniqueness of this value.
                                         (Thompson & al) connect linear algebra concepts to the structure of optimal solutions.

                                         Following Thompson, we consider the matrix pencil $$P(\lambda)=A-\lambda S$$.
                                         Concepts: generalised characteristic polynomial, eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
                                         A fundamental result is due to Thompson et al.

                         Complete information security games assume mutual knowledge of strategies, by both the attacker and defender. 
                         In real-world scenarios, this could correspond to a situation where the attacker might be able to gain some knowledge. 
                         For example, through:
                             insider information
                             information leakage
                             reconnaissance
                         The defender might be aware of potential attackers and their motivation through security assessment and risk analysis.

                             Constraints in defense budget can be taken into account.
                             Big security games are usually non-zero-sum games.
                             Typically, they have 2 players but a large number of actions.
                             A compact notation helps with efficiently storing and solving the game.

                         Strategies -- Attacker #slide 
                             The attacker can choose between __pure__ or __mixed__ strategies.
                                 Pure strategy space:
                                     $$s_A= {\mathcal T}$$ -- the set of targets,
                                 Mixed strategy space:
                                     $$s_A= \{(q_1,q_2,\ldots q_n )\}$$ where $$0 \le q_j \le 1 $$ and $$\sum q_j=1 $$ represents the probability of attacking target $$t_i$$. 
                             Example: Case Study 1
                                 The attacker can choose random YouTube channels as his targets, using an automated script. This implements a mixed strategy.
                         Strategies -- Defender #slide 
                             $${\mathcal S}$$ -- set of __feasible schedules__, representing specific allocations of resources to cover targets (respecting a finite budget constraint).
                             There are $$d={n \choose m}$$ such feasible schedules.
                             Pure strategy:
                                 This is a feasible schedule $$s_D \in {\mathcal S}$$, covering $$m$$ out of $$n$$ targets.
                                 Notation: $$s = \langle i_1,i_2,\ldots i_n \rangle$$  ($$i_j \in \{0, 1\}$$, $$\sum i_j = m$$).
                                     $$s \subset {\mathcal T}$$ ($$|s| = m$$) -- set notation  #wfe-ignore-item 
                             Mixed strategy:
                                 $$s_D = ( p_1,p_2,\ldots p_d )$$ where $$0 \le p_j \le 1$$ are probabilities of using a feasible schedule.
                                 This induces a __coverage vector__ $$c = \langle c_{1},\ldots, c_{n} \rangle$$, expressing the probability of protection for each of the targets.
                         Utilities #slide 
                             Compact notations: utility per use/attack of $$t_i$$
                                 $$u_D^c(t_i)$$ -- defender's utility when target $$t_i$$ is covered by at least one resource,
                                 $$u_D^u(t_i)$$ -- defender's utility for uncovered target $$t_i$$,
                                 $$u_A^c(t_i)$$ -- attacker's utility for a covered target $$t_i$$,
                                 $$u_A^u(t_i)$$ -- attacker's utility, when $$t_i$$ is uncovered.
                             $$u_D^c(t_i) - u_D^u(t_i) = 0$$ if $$t_i$$ is not attacked.
                         Assumptions/Properties #slide
                             Applying resources to a target benefits the defender and hurts the attacker:
                                 $$\Delta u_D(t_i) := u_D^c(t_i) - u_D^u(t_i) > 0$$ -- the defender's utility reduction due to loss of coverage on attack,
                                 $$\Delta u_A(t_i) :=  u_A^u(t_i)-u_A^c(t_i) > 0$$ -- the attacker's utility gain when attacked target not covered.
                             These assumptions are realistic, for the considered scenario.
                         Example: Case Study 1 #slide

                             The corresponding expected payoffs are 2.68 and 2.83.
                             These are coverage vectors, from which suitable feasible schedules can be computed.

                             Strategic security games are smaller versions and specialisations of the massive 2-player security games.
                             Motivation for their use in modelling security scenarios:
                                 They are insightful for theoretical analysis as they can be solved explicitly
                                 They are suitable for certain specific real-world scenarios, e.g. 
                                     Security assessment, as risk analysis mostly considers single asset at a time
                                     Vulnerability scoring, as a game-theoretic version of CVSS, as only deals with one vulnerability at the time
                             Analysis is inspired by typical considerations in game theory, e.g. for the famous Prisoner's Dilemma.

                         For the special case of security games as introduced in \cite{@Kiekintveld2009}, more specialised methods have been developed.
                         , exploiting properties specific to these types of games and reducing the bimatrix game to a matrix (zero-sum) game \cite{@Korzhyk2011a}. Other transformation techniques are given in \cite{}. By relaxing the assumption of algebraic independence of  the matrices $$A$$ and $$B$$, algorithmic game analysis is simplified. In \cite{}, the authors show how to compute optimal Nash Equilibria if the game matrices are linked by an affine transformation. [ #todo More recent refs] The notion of strategical equivalence as defined in \cite{@Moulin1978} can also be characterised in terms of algebraic relations however it does not seem applicable to arbitrary security games \cite{@Korzhyk2011a}.

                         \item the innocent suspect would rather not shoot even if the sheriff shoots.
                         \end{itemize}
                         We are facing a bayesian game were sheriff doesn't possess full information about his oponnent. In particular,the criminal possess a \textit{private information} that the sheriff should take into account when forming expectation about how the criminal would behave. To analyse the interesting Dilemma, we begin with a class of games of incomplete infor-
                         mation (i.e. games where at least one player is uncertain about another player’s payoff func-
                         tion) that are the analogue of the normal form games with complete information:Bayesian
                         games.
                         The payoffs are as following :
                         \[\ Mat_{Bad\_suspect} = \bordermatrix{~ &amp; Shoot &amp; Not \cr
                             Shoot &amp; 0,0 &amp; 2,-2 \cr
                                 Not &amp; -2,-1 &amp; -1,1 \cr}\]
                         \[\ Mat_{Good\_suspect} = \bordermatrix{~ &amp; Shoot &amp; Not \cr
                             Shoot &amp; -3,-1 &amp; -1,-2 \cr
                                 Not &amp; -2,-1 &amp; 0,0 \cr}\]
                         For a good suspect(innocent) that shoots the sheriff would have a better payoff of $$-1$$  if he shoots(it's a negative payoff because we are shooting an inoncent), otherwise he would be killed and get payoff of $$-2$$. The best payoff would not shooting for both.
                         For the bad suspect(guilty),the sheriff would rather shoot if the suspect shoots and that's best payoff for both $$(0,0)$$. In the case the criminal does not shoot he would be taken to jail and gets a payoff of $$-1$$ and the sheriff gets a payoff of $$1$$ for capturing the criminal.
                     Pure strategy Bayesian Nash Equilibrium analysis
                         This type of incomplete games are so difficult to solve and people has been stuck for many years. However, John C. Harsanyi proposed a method that allowed one to transform the game of incomplete information into a game of imperfect information(good news is that we can solve games of imperfect information)which could then be analyzed with standard techniques. In brief,the\textbf{Harsanyi transformation} include a variable called \textit{Nature} that determines the suspect's type (Good or guilty), transforming the incomple information of sheriff about the suspect into imperfect information about the move by \textit{Nature}.

                         %\caption{ The Harsanyi-Transformed Game}
                         %\end{center}
                         %\end{figure*}
                         As stated, Nature moves first and chooses the guilty suspect with probability of $$\pi$$ and the good suspect with a probability of $$1- \pi$$ . All the sheriff knows is the probability of him being of one type or another. It is quite important to note that here sheriff's beliefs are
                         \textit{common knowledge}. That means that suspect knows what he believes his type to be, and he knows that he knows, and so on. This is important because suspect will be optimizing given what he thinks sheriff will do, and his behavior depends on these beliefs. We can now apply the Nash equilibrium solution concept to this new game. Harsanyi’sBayesian Nash Equilibrium(or simply Bayesian Equilibrium) is precisely the Nash equilibrium of this imperfect-information representation of the game. The bayesian Nash equilibrium will be a triple of strategies: one for the suspect of the guilty type, another for suspect of the good type, and one for the sheriff. In equilibrium, no deviation should be profitable.
                         We denote $$S$$ for \textit{Shoot} and $$\overline{S}$$ for \textit{Not shoot}. The suspect's pure strategies are \textsc{\{$$SS$$,$$S\overline{S}$$,$$\overline{S}S$$,$$\overline{S}\overline{S}$$\}}. Where the first component of each pair tells what to do if guilty and the second what to do if innocent. Sheriff has only two pure strategies \textsc{\{$$S$$,$$\overline{S}$$\}}. The resulting payoff matrix is shown as following:
                             \[\bordermatrix{~ &amp; S &amp; \overline{S} \cr
                                 SS &amp; 0.p-3.(1-\pi),0.p-1.(1-\pi) &amp; 2.\pi-1.(1-\pi),-2.\pi-2.(1-\pi) \cr
                                     S\overline{S} &amp; 0.p-2.(1-\pi),0.p-1.(1-\pi) &amp; 2.\pi-0.(1-\pi),-2.\pi-0.(1-\pi) \cr
                                     \overline{S}S &amp; -2.\pi-3.(1-\pi),-1.\pi-1.(1-\pi) &amp; -1.\pi-1.(1-\pi),1.\pi-2.(1-\pi) \cr
                                     \overline{S}\overline{S} &amp; -2.\pi-2.(1-\pi),-1.\pi-1.(1-\pi) &amp; -1.\pi+0.(1-\pi),1.\pi+0.(1-\pi) \cr
                                         } \]
                             \[=\bordermatrix{~ &amp; S &amp; \overline{S} \cr
                                 SS &amp; -3.(1-\pi),-(1-\pi) &amp; 2.\pi-(1-\pi),-2 \cr
                                     S\overline{S} &amp; -2.(1-\pi),-(1-\pi) &amp; 2.\pi,-2.\pi\cr
                                     \overline{S}S &amp; -2.\pi-3.(1-\pi),-1 &amp; -1,\pi-2.(1-\pi) \cr
                                     \overline{S}\overline{S} &amp; -2,-1&amp; -\pi,\pi\cr
                                         } \]
                         We see that $$S\overline{S}$$ strictly dominate all the three strategies $$\{SS,\overline{S}S,\overline{S}\overline{S}\}$$. We can eliminate all this three strategies and keep the dominant one.
                         \[\bordermatrix{~ &amp; S &amp; \overline{S} \cr
                             S\overline{S} &amp; -2.(1-\pi),-(1-\pi) &amp; 2.\pi,-2.\pi\cr
                                 } \]
                         This reducted strategic form means that either the sherrif shoots or not the best response would be shooting if bad suspect and not shooting if good suspect $$S\overline{S}$$. This can be seen obviously from the two payoff matrix where shooting is a dominant strategy for the bad suspect and likewise not shooting for the good suspect.
                         However,sherrif's optimal strategy depends on his prediction about the suspect. In fact, if the suspect choose his his optimal strategy which is $$S\overline{S}$$, the best response that maximise the profit is: $$max(-(1-\pi),-2.\pi)$$ which depends on the value of $$\pi$$. Hence, sherrifs's optimal response is shooting if $$\pi&gt;1/3$$ , not shooting if $$\pi&lt;1/3$$  and random strategy if $$\pi=1/3$$. This is logic since a nature that has a higher probability of being bad supect exceeding $$1/3$$ should be shot.
                         Summarizing the results, we have the folowing Nash equilibria( We remind that the bayesian Nash Equilibrium is a triple of strategies):
                         \begin{itemize}
                         \item if $$\boldsymbol{\pi&gt;1/3}$$, then \textbf{\{Shooting if bad suspect,not shooting if good suspect,and sherrif shoots\}} is a BNE
                         \item if $$\boldsymbol{\pi&lt;1/3}$$, then \textbf{\{Shooting if bad suspect,not shooting if good suspect,and sherrif don't shoot\}} is BNE
                         \item if $$\boldsymbol{\pi=1/3}$$, then \textbf{\{Shooting if bad suspect,not shooting if good suspect,and sherrif radomely shoots or not\}} is BNE
                         \end{itemize}
                     Mixed strategy Bayesian Nash Equilibrium analysis
                         As to obtain the mixed strategies, we have to make another kind of analysis and try to replicate the three BNE obtained before. Assume the probabilities of playing each action are as shown in the matrices below. $$y$$ is the probability Sheriff plays $$Shoot$$ (not conditional on the matrix since this is an information Sheriff does not have), $$x$$ is the probability suspect plays $$Shoot$$
                         if he is guilty and z is the probability suspect plays $$shoot$$ if he is good).
                         $$ \matrix{\mbox{Guilty}&amp;y&amp;1-y\\x &amp; 0,0 &amp; 2,-2\\1-x&amp; -2,-1 &amp; -1,1}      \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad
                         \matrix{\mbox{Good}&amp;y&amp;1-y\\z&amp; -3,-1 &amp; -1,-2\\1-z&amp; -2,-1 &amp; 0,0}$$
                         \subsubsection{Suspect best response}
                         \begin{itemize}
                         \item The suspect's best response if he is guilty: \\
                         He would rather choose chooting if the expected payoff of shooting exceed the expected payoff of not shooting. Since this strategy is dominant, whatever the sheriff plays ($$y \in [0,1]$$), shooting for suspect is the optimal strategy ($$x=1$$). We conclude that:\\
                         \Rmnum{1)} $$y \in [0,1] \Rightarrow
                         x=1$$
                         \item The suspect's best response if he is good: \\
                         Same as before, we conclude that \\
                         \Rmnum{2)} $$y \in [0,1] \Rightarrow
                         z=0$$
                         \item The sheriff's best response: \\
                         We recall that sheriff does not know wich type the suspect is, assigning a probability of $$\pi$$ to be guilty or not). The sheriff would play $$Shoot$$ instead of $$Not Shoot$$ ($$y=1$$) if: \\
                         $$\pi[0.x-1.(1-x)]+(1-\pi)[-1.z -1.(1-z)] &gt; \pi[-2.x+1.(1-x)]+(1-\pi)[-2.z +0.(1-z)] $$
                         $$\Leftrightarrow \pi(x-1)-(1-\pi) &gt; \pi(-3.x+1)-2.(1-\pi).z $$ \\
                         $$\Leftrightarrow 4.\pi.x  &gt; \pi+1 + 2.(\pi-1).z $$
                         Wich can be summarized as : \\
                         \Rmnum{3)} $$4.\pi.x  &gt; \pi+1 + 2.(\pi-1).z \Rightarrow y=1  $$ \\
                         \Rmnum{4)} $$4.\pi.x  &lt; \pi+1 + 2.(\pi-1).z \Rightarrow y=0  $$ \\
                         \Rmnum{5)} $$4.\pi.x  = \pi+1 + 2.(\pi-1).z \Rightarrow y \in [0,1] $$ \\
                         \subsubsection{Mixed equilibria}
                         We have to found the mixed strategies \{$${x^\star,y^\star,z^\star}$$\} that verifie all the five conditions above.
                         \textbf{Possible Case 1:} \\
                         If $$y^\star \in [0,1] $$, it means that $${x^\star = 1}$$ from \Rmnum{1} and $$z^\star= 0$$ from \Rmnum{2}. From \Rmnum{5},we can see that in order $$y^\star$$ belongs to the interval between 0 and 1 it should be the case :  $$4.\pi.x  = \pi+1 + 2.(\pi-1).z $$. By subtituting the values of $${x^\star}$$ and $${z^\star}$$. We found that $$\pi=1/3$$. This supports the third pure Nash equilibrium  that we  found before \textbf{\{Shooting if bad suspect,not shooting if good suspect,and sherrif radomely shoots or not\}}.
                         \textbf{Possible Case 2:} \\
                         If sheriffs choose to shoot, wich means $$y^{\star}=1$$. We have to make sure that the condition \Rmnum{3} hold. Since $$y^{\star}=1 \in [0,1] $$, $${x^\star = 1}$$ from \Rmnum{1} and $$z^\star= 0$$ from \Rmnum{2}. So all the three condition gives $$\pi&gt;1/3$$. This supports the third pure Nash equilibrium  that we  found before \textbf{\{Shooting if bad suspect,not shooting if good suspect,and sherrif shoots\}}.
                         \textbf{Possible Case 3:} \\
                         If sheriffs choose not to shoot, wich means $$y^{\star}=1$$. We have to make sure that the condition \Rmnum{4} hold. Since $$y^{\star}=0 \in [0,1] $$, $${x^\star = 1}$$ from \Rmnum{1} and $$z^\star= 0$$ from \Rmnum{2}. So all the three condition gives $$\pi&lt;1/3$$. This supports the third pure Nash equilibrium  that we  found before \textbf{\{Shooting if bad suspect,not shooting if good suspect,and sherrif don't shoot\}}.
                         We found that there is only pure strategies in our dilemma's case. This is du to the existence of dominant strategies for suspect.

                                         Zero-sum
                                             Payoffs of one player are the negative of the payoffs of the other player
                                             One player wins if and only if the other player loses
                                             Example: chess
                                             If best responses of both players coincide, they are optimal. Value of the game?

                                             Is a competition
                                             One player wins
                                         Constant-sum
                                             Payoffs of the two players always add up to a constant no what strategy is used
                                             Example: squash
                                     Number of Players
                                         Most GT models treat the case of 2 players
                                         This is often sufficient for attacker/defence scenarios (as in Computer Security)
                                         Situation far more complicated if more than 2 players
                                         There is some literature on 3-player models with applications to non-security domains

                                             Each player has a private plan of actions
                                             All players’ decision are made simultaneously

                                         Dynamic/Extensive/Sequential/Hierarchical Game
                                             Has more than one stages/shots/moves/rounds in each of which the players can consider their action
                                             E.g. Two-shot Game
                                             Is a sequential-move game and players choose their strategies in sequence
                                             Can have infinite number of stages, in which case it is Infinite Game
                                             Otherwise, it is a finite game

                                         Perfect Information Game
                                             Each player is aware of the actions of all other players that have already taken place
                                             Example: tic-tac-toe, chess
                                         Imperfect Information Game
                                             At least one player is not aware of the actions of at least one other player that have taken place
                                             Example: Card game Bridge, poker

                                         Complete Information Game
                                             Every player knows the strategies and payoffs of all players in the game
                                             But not necessarily all the actions
                                         Incomplete Information Game
                                             At least one player is unaware of the possible strategies and payoffs for at least one of the other players
                                             This introduces uncertainty

                                     Uncertainty
                                         There are two sources of uncertainty
                                             Uncertainty about the preferences or capabilities of an opponent (Incomplete Information)
                                             Uncertainty about the previous actions of other players (Imperfect Information)
                                             However, incomplete information can be converted into imperfect information
                                 Equilibriums
                                     Nash Equilibrium
                                         it is a fundamental concept and most used solution concept in game theory
                                         Named after John Forbes Nash, Jr.
                                         it involves a minimum of two players and each player is assumed to know the equilibrium strategies of other players and no player gain if the player's own strategy is changed
                                         Steady state condition of a game
                                         No player changes strategy because it will lower his payoffs given that all other players are following the prescribed strategy
                                         No player can improve their utility through a "unilateral" change of strategy
                                         Does not specify how steady state is reached

                                         Formal Definition of NE 
                                             Let $$(S, f)$$ be a game with $$n$$ players, where $$S_i$$ is the strategy set for player $$i$$
                                             $$S=S_1 \times S_2 \times \dotsb \times S_n$$ is the set of [[Strategy (game theory)|strategy profiles]]
                                             $$f(x)=(f_1(x), \dotsc, f_n(x))$$ is its payoff function evaluated at $$x \in S$$. 
                                             Let $$x_i$$ be a strategy profile of player $$i$$ and $$x_{-i}$$ be a strategy profile of all players except for player $$i$$. 
                                             When each player $$i \in \{1, \dotsc, n\}$$ chooses strategy $$x_i$$ resulting in strategy profile $$x = (x_1, \dotsc, x_n)$$ then player $$i$$ obtains payoff $$f_i(x)$$. 
                                             Note that the payoff depends on the strategy profile chosen, i.e., on the strategy chosen by player $$i$$ as well as the strategies chosen by all the other players. 
                                             A strategy profile $$x^* \in S$$ is a Nash equilibrium (NE) if no unilateral deviation in strategy by any single player is profitable for that player, that is:$$\forall i,x_i\in S_i :  f_i(x^*_{i}, x^*_{-i}) \geq f_i(x_{i},x^*_{-i}).$$
                                             When the inequality above holds strictly (with &gt; instead of &ge;) for all players and all feasible alternative strategies, then the equilibrium is classified as a ''strict Nash equilibrium''. If instead, for some player, there is exact equality between $$x^*_i$$ and some other strategy in the set $$S$$, then the equilibrium is classified as a ''weak Nash equilibrium''.

                                     Incomplete information about the strategies and payoffs
                                         In particular, one player has incomplete information about the other player.
                                         Can be modelled by introducing Nature as a player in the game (Nature is a random value (signal))

                                         What does it mean and how is it related to Nature?
                                         Harsanyi invented the trick of converting games of incomplete information to games of imperfect information, by introducing nature as an additional player
                                 Basic Concepts
                                     Bayesian are methods in probability and statistics named after Thomas Bayes. These methods include Bayesian Games which provides a new way for analysing incomplete information games. In such games, there is a certain belief with a known probability distribution
                                     John Harsanyi developed a new theory for analysing games: Bayesian Games
                                         "developing the highly innovative analysis of games of incomplete information, so-called Bayesian games"
                                     Bayesian game consists of:
                                         finite set N (the set of players)
                                             each player has his own set of actions
                                             each player has a finite set of signals and a signal function
                                             each player has a prior belief
                                             each player has a preference relation
                                         finite set set of $$\Omega$$ (the set of states)
                                     Bayesian Games (Games of Incomplete information) represents players' uncertainties about the game player
                                         Uncertainty is presented within a set using probability distribution of the game played

                         \label{single-target-section}
                         Goal of this section is to apply the algebraic framework developed in the previous section to a bimatrix Bayesian vulnerability patching game. The analysis in order to analyse this game. This will provide the equations needed for the vulnerability scoring functions introduced in the next section. #signpost

                             The loss $$l^{\mathcal{A}}$$ in the defender's utility function is due to the attack impact, exploiting the vulnerability $$v$$ and affecting the asset's CIA security requirements. 
                             This can be modelled as follows, using the CVSS CIA impact subscores and value components of the asset $$a$$:
                             $$l^{\mathcal{D}}(a) =\vec{\mu}_{Imp} \cdot \vec{V}(a) = \mu_{Imp, C} \cdot V_C(a) + \mu_{Imp, I} \cdot V_I(a) + \mu_{Imp, A} \cdot V_A(a).$$ @asset-loss-definition

                                 The goal in this section is to make our previous CVSS game more suitable for real-world scenarios, by introducing information asymmetry. 
                                 Equation @equation shows that we have to impose the condition $$0 \leq 1 - \frac{\alpha}{L \cdot \mu_E} \leq 1 \Longleftrightarrow 0\le \frac{\alpha}{L} \le  \mu_E$$ in order to ensure that $$p^*$$ can be used as a probability in the mixed Nash equilibrium strategy.

                 Multi-Criteria Optimisation – The Basics #slide
                     Many real-world problems involve multiple conflicting objectives.
                     Examples:
                         Design: Minimize weight, maximize strength
                         Finance: Maximize return, minimize risk
                     Goal: Identify trade-offs between objectives.
                 Pareto Optimality (Multi-Criteria Optimisation) #slide
                     Definition: A solution is Pareto optimal if no other feasible solution improves one objective without worsening at least one other.
                     Formal (minimisation case): Let $$f: X 
                 Visualising the Pareto Front #slide
                     The Pareto front consists of all Pareto optimal solutions in objective space.
                     Represents the best trade-offs between competing objectives.
                     Often visualised in 2D with dominated points below the curve.
                 Partial Orders and Pareto Dominance #slide
                     Pareto dominance defines a partial order on $$\mathbb{R}^k$$: $$u \prec v \iff (\forall i,\ u_i \leq v_i) \land (\exists j,\ u_j < v_j)$$
                     This relation is:
                         Reflexive
                         Antisymmetric
                         Transitive
                     Pareto optimal points are the maximal elements under this partial order.
                 Bimatrix Games – Setup #slide
                     Two players, each with a finite set of strategies.
                     Each strategy profile $$(s_1, s_2)$$ results in a payoff pair: $$(u_1(s_1, s_2),\ u_2(s_1, s_2)) \in \mathbb{R}^2$$
                     Each component represents one player’s utility.
                     Payoffs are evaluated jointly in $$\mathbb{R}^2$$.
                 Pareto Optimality in Bimatrix Games #slide
                     Definition: A strategy profile is Pareto optimal if no other profile improves one player’s payoff without reducing the other’s.

                     (C, C) = (3, 3) is Pareto optimal.
                     (D, D) = (1, 1) is a Nash equilibrium, but not Pareto optimal.

                 Key Takeaways #slide
                     Pareto optimality reflects non-dominance in both frameworks.
                     In multi-objective optimisation: trade-offs occur within one agent’s goals.
                     In games: trade-offs occur between independent agents.
                     Both rely on partial orders to define efficiency and non-dominance.

                 Vandermonde Matrix -- Factorisation #slide 
                     Interesting factorisation properties:
                         $$V(x) = V_L(x) V_R(x)$$ 
                     Here
                         $$V_L(x) = $$
                         $$ V_R(x) =$$
                 Sampling and Interpolation #slide 
                     Given $$f(x,y) = \displaystyle \sum^m_{i=1} \sum^n_{j=1} a_{ij} x^i y^j \in \mathbb{F}_p[x,y]$$, we evaluate (sample) as
                         $$f(x_i,y_j) = b_{ij} \in \mathbb{F}_p$$.
                     This can be written as $$V(x_1,\ldots,x_m) A V(y_1,\ldots,y_n) = B$$. 
                     Hence if $$n=m$$, the coefficient matrix $$A$$ is square and can be computed as
                         $$A=V^{-1}(x_1,\ldots,x_n) B V^{-1}(y_1,\ldots,y_n)$$
                     if $$x_i\neq x_j$$ and $$y_i\neq y_j$$.
                     Note: if $$f$$ is symmetric, then so will be the matrices $$A$$ and $$B$$.

                 LP Standard Canonical Form #slide 
                     A standard form of the LP is to choose $$y_1,\ldots,y$$, to maximize
                         $$ c_1y_1 + \cdots + c_ny$$, 
                     subject to the constraints
                         $$a_{11}y_1 + \cdots + a_{1n}y_n \le b_1$$

                     and $$b_i\ge 0$$, $$y_j \ge 0$$ for $$ i = 1,\ldots,m$$ and $$ j = 1,\ldots,n$$.
                     In compact notation this is:
                         MAX $$c^T y$$  ST $$Ay\le b$$ and $$y\ge 0$$. 
                 LP Augmented Canonical Form #slide #simplex:augmented 
                     Idea: convert the system of inequality constraints into a system of equations, subject to some positivity conditions.
                     The __augmented canonical__ form of the LP is: 
                         Find $$y_1,\ldots,y_n$$ to maximise
                             $$z= c_1y_1 + \cdots + c_ny+d$$
                         subject to the constraints
                             $$a_{11}y_1 + \cdots + a_{1n}y_n + {\hat{y}}_1= b_1$$,
                               $$\vdots$$
                             $$a_{m1}y_1 + \cdots + a_{mn}y_n+ {\hat{y}}_{m}= b_m$$
                         where $$y_j \ge 0$$ for $$ j = 1,\ldots,n$$ and $${\hat{y}}_j \ge 0$$ for $$ j = 1,\ldots,m$$.
                     The $$\hat{y}_j$$ are called the __slack variables__ or __basic solutions__. 
                 The Revised Simplex Method #h
                     Using Matrix Notation #slide 
                         The augmented/canonical form contains a linear system which can be expressed using matrices:
                             $$\max z := c^\top x+d:$$
                                 $$ Ax+\hat{x}=b \,\land \, z-c^\top x=d \Longleftrightarrow $$
                                 $$\begin{pmatrix}  0& A&I\\  1 & -c^\top&0\\ \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}  z\\ x  \\  \hat{x}  \\   \end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}   b  \\ d  \\ \end{pmatrix}$$. 
                         Here, $$x$$ contains the __non-basic solutions__ and $$\hat{x}$$ the __basic solutions__.
                         A __feasible solution__ is any solution $$\begin{pmatrix} x \\ \hat{x}\end{pmatrix}$$, satisfying the constraints.
                     Main Idea #slide 
                         Denote the system during a step of iteration $$k$$ as:
                             $$\begin{pmatrix}  0& {A}_{{k}}&I\\  1 & -{c}^\top_{{k}}&0\\ \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} z\\ x_{{k}} \\  \hat{x}_{{k}}  \\  \end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix} {b}_{{k}}  \\  {d}_{{k}} \\  \end{pmatrix}$$.
                         Successive left-multiplication with matrix $$R_{{k+1}}$$ implements row-operations, increasing the value of $$z$$:
                             $$\begin{pmatrix}  0& {A}_{{k+1}}&I\\  1 & -{c}^\top_{{k+1}}&0\\ \end{pmatrix}=R_{{k}}\begin{pmatrix}  0& {A}_{{k}}&I\\  1 & -{c}^\top_{{k}}&0\\ \end{pmatrix}$$,
                             $$\begin{pmatrix} {b}_{{k+1}}  \\  {d}_{{k+1}} \\  \end{pmatrix}=P_{{k}}\begin{pmatrix} {b}_{{k}}  \\  {d}_{{k}} \\  \end{pmatrix}$$.
                     Initialisation and Termination #slide #simplex:exit 
                         We start with $$b_0=b, d_0=0$$ and put $$x_{0} =0$$ and $$\hat{x}_{0}=b_0$$, satisfying the lower block-row. #simplex:init
                         Iterations terminate once the row-vector $$-{c}^\top_{k}$$ is nonnegative. 
                         Reason:
                             Maximising $$z_k= {d}^\top_{k}+{c}^\top_{k} x_k$$ and $${c}^\top_{k} \leqq 0$$ is solved by $$x_k=0$$. 
                         Hence:
                             $$z= {d}_k$$ is the optimal value.
                             $$(x,\hat{x})=(0,\hat{x}_{{k}})$$ is a feasible solution for the augmented system
                             CORRECT THIS:, hence of the original LP.  
                     Pivot-Step #slide #simplex:pivot 
                         In this step, subject to some assumptions, fix a row index $$i$$ and column index $$j$$. 
                         Denote the $$j$$th column of a matrix $$A$$ as $$\text{col}(A,j)$$.
                         Assume we can form $$R$$ non-singular such that $$R \;\text{col}(A,j) =  e_i $$.
                         Multiplying the entire system of linear equations by $$R$$ on the left allows swapping the non-basic variable $$x_j$$ and basic variable $$\hat{x}_i$$.
                     Determining $$i$$ and $$j$$ #slide 
                         In this step, a suitable row index $$i$$ and column index $$j$$ need to be found. 
                         The previous operation increases $$z$$, provided the $$i$$th entry of the vector $$R\tilde{b}$$ is greater than zero. 
                         This is equivalent to stating 
                             $$\exist i: b/a_{ij} > 0$$
                         We then chose $$i := \argmax_i \{ b/a_{ij} \}$$.

                         Problem Statement #slide 
                             Let us consider the game problem from Player I’s point of view. 
                             Applying the Principle of Indifference, our goal is to now maximise $$v(x)=\min_{j\in\{1..m\}}xA_j$$ where 
                                 $$A_j$$ corresponds to column $$j$$ of $$A$$,
                                 $$x=(x_1 \ldots x_n)$$ is the set of mixed strategies.
                             He wants to choose $$x_1,\ldots,x_m$$ to maximize @NE-zero-sum-x:ref  subject to the constraint $$ x \in X^*$$. 
                             This is subject to the constraints
                                 $$\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i = 1$$
                                 $$x_i \ge 0 $$ for $$i = 1,\ldots,n$$
                             This becomes the mathematical program: 
                                 Choose $$x_1,\ldots,x_m$$ to maximize
                                     $$\min_{1 \le j\le n}\sum_{i=1}^{m} x_ia_{ij}$$ #equation
                                 subject to the constraints
                                     $$x_1 + \ldots + x_m = 1 $$
                                 and
                                     $$ x_i \ge 0$$ for $$i = 1,\ldots,m$$.
                             The objective function is not a linear function of the $$x$$’s because of the $$\min$$ operator, so this is not a linear program. 
                             However, it can be changed into a linear program through a trick. 
                         Approach 1 #h 
                             The Reduction #slide 
                                 Add one new variable $$v$$ to Player I’s list of variables
                                 Restrict it to be less than the objective function: $$v \le \min_{1 \ge j \ge n}\sum_{i=1}^{m} p_ia_{ij} $$
                                 Try to make $$v$$ as large as possible subject to this new constraint.  The problem becomes:
                                     Maximize $$v$$
                                     Subject to constraints :
                                         $$v - \sum_{i=1}^{m}p_ia_{ij}\le 0$$ for $$j = 1,\ldots,n$$
                                         $$\sum_{i=1}^{m}p_i = 1$$
                                         $$p_i \ge 0 $$ for $$i = 1,\ldots,m$$

                                 This can be written also using a matrix product:
                                 Maximize $$ f = \tilde{c}^t\tilde{x}$$ subject to $$\tilde{A}\tilde{x} \le \tilde{b} $$ where
                                     $$\tilde{c} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ \vdots\\0\\1 \end{bmatrix}$$, $$\tilde{x} = \begin{bmatrix} x^t \\v \end{bmatrix}$$ 
                                 and
                                     $$\tilde{A}=\begin{pmatrix} -A^t & e \\ e^t& 0 \\  -e^t& 0   \end{pmatrix}$$ , $$\tilde{b} = \begin{bmatrix}0\\1\\-1 \end{bmatrix}$$
                                 and $$\tilde{x} \ge 0$$. 
                             Proof  #slide 
                                 We have $$ \tilde{c}^t\tilde{x}   = \begin{bmatrix} 0 &.&.&0&1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x^t \\v \end{bmatrix}  = v$$ so maximizing $$f$$ is the same as maximizing $$v$$ which is our objective:
                                     $$\tilde{A}\tilde{x}  =\begin{pmatrix} -A^t & \begin {matrix} 1 \\ . \\ . \\ 1 \end{matrix} \\ \begin{matrix} 1 &. &.&1 \end{matrix} & 0 \\  \begin{matrix} -1 &. &.&-1 \end{matrix} & 0   \end{pmatrix}  \begin{bmatrix} x^t \\v \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}- \sum_{i=1}^{n}p_ia_{i1} + v \\ \vdots \\- \sum_{i=1}^{n}p_ia_{im} +v \\ \sum_{i=1}^{n}p_i \\ -\sum_{i=1}^{n}p_i\end{bmatrix}  $$
$$ \tilde{A}\tilde{x} \le \tilde{b} \Leftrightarrow v - \sum_{i=1}^{n}p_ia_{ij}\le 0 , j \in [|1 \ldots m|] ;\sum_{i=1}^{n}p_i \le 1 ;  -\sum_{i=1}^{n}p_i \le -1$$
$$\Leftrightarrow  v - \sum_{i=1}^{n}p_ia_{ij}\le 0 , j \in [|1 \ldots m|] ;\sum_{i=1}^{n}p_i = 1$$ 
                             Example #slide
                                 Consider the game matrix $$ A = \begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{pmatrix}$$. 
                                 We set 
                                     $$\tilde{x} = \begin{bmatrix} p_1 \\p_2 \\v \end{bmatrix}$$, $$\tilde{c} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\0\\1 \end{bmatrix}$$ 
                                 and obtain 
                                     $$\tilde{A}=\begin{pmatrix} -1 & -3 &1 \\-2&-4&1\\1&1&0\\-1&-1&0 \end{pmatrix}$$, $$\tilde{b} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\0\\1\\-1 \end{bmatrix}$$.

                             Simplification #slide 
                                 We can achieve $$v >0$$ by adding some constant $$c$$ that is at least equal to the maxmin of the matrix.
                                 We perform a change of variable:
                                     $$x' = (x'_1,\ldots,x'_m)$$ where $$x'_i = {x_i}/{v}$$ for $$i =1,\ldots,m$$. 
                                 Maximizing $$v$$ is the same as minimizing $$\sum_{i=1}^{m}x'_i = \frac{1}{v}$$ subject to constraints $$1 \le \sum_{i=1}^{m}x_i'a_{ij}$$ for $$j = i,\ldots,n$$.

                                     Subject to constraints :
                                         $$xA \ge e^\top_m$$
                                         $$x\ge 0$$ 
                             Obtaining the Solutions #slide 
                                 We have $$\sum_{i=1}^{m}x_i = 1 $$ which implies that $$\sum_{i=1}^{m}x'_i = \frac{1}{v}$$. 
                                 Unwinding the formulation back to our original variables, we find the optimal strategy X for player I and the value of the game as follows:(the minimum objective is denoted $$ z_1^{*}$$)
                                 $$v(A) = \frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^{m}p'_{i}}=\frac{1}{z_1^*}$$ and $$p_i=p'_i . v(A)$$ 
                                 After the optimum solution is obtained, the true value of the game is obtained by subtracting that constant.

                 Linear Markov Models #slide 
                     Markov modeling belongs to the area of mathematics known as probability theory. 
                     It is a mathematical technique used to model systems that change over time and whose future behavior depends only on their present state, not on their past history.
                     Markov models are based on Markov processes, which are stochastic models that assume that the future state of a system depends only on its present state and not on its past. 
                     Stochastic process where future states depend linearly on current state
                     Can be represented by a transition matrix
                 Markov processes -- Transition Matrix #slide 
                     They are often represented using a state transition matrix, where each element of the matrix represents the probability of transitioning from one state to another in a single time step.
                 State Concepts
                     There are various notations and concepts associated with Markov models, including state spaces, transition probabilities, steady-state probabilities, initial state distributions, and absorbing states. 
                 Types #slide 
                     Additionally, various types of Markov models exist, such as discrete-time Markov chains, continuous-time Markov chains, hidden Markov models, and Markov decision processes, each with its own unique characteristics and applications.
                 Properties of Linear Markov Models #slide 
                     Time-homogeneous: Transition matrix is constant over time
                     Markovian: Future states only depend on current state, not on past history
                     Stationary: A stationary distribution exists and can be found by solving a linear system of equations
                     Can model a wide range of phenomena, from stock prices to weather patterns to genetic mutations
                 Stationary State #slide 
                     Note that in some cases, the stationary distribution may not exist or may be a mixture of multiple distributions, in which case the long-run behavior of the Markov chain may be more complicated.
                     A stationary state exists for a linear Markov model if and only if the transition matrix has a unique left eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $$1$$, where the left eigenvector is defined as a row vector that satisfies the equation $$\pi P = \pi$$.
                     Here, $$\pi$$ represents the stationary distribution and $$P$$ represents the transition matrix. 
                     The elements of $$\pi$$ represent the long-run probabilities of being in each state of the Markov chain.
                     Stationary distribution exists if all eigenvalues of transition matrix are less than 1 in magnitude
                 Transition Matrix #slide 
                     In order for the stationary distribution to exist, the transition matrix must also be irreducible and aperiodic. 
                     A matrix is irreducible if it is possible to reach any state from any other state in a finite number of steps. 
                     A matrix is aperiodic if the period of each state is $$1$$, which means that it is not possible to get stuck in a cycle of visiting the same set of states repeatedly.
                     If the transition matrix satisfies these conditions, then the stationary distribution can be found by solving the linear system of equations:
                     $$\pi P = \pi$$ ($$\sum_{i}\pi_i = 1$$)
                     where the second equation enforces the normalization condition that the probabilities add up to $$1$$.
                 Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods can be used to sample from stationary distribution
         Von Neumann Growth Model #h Unique
             INBOX
                 The **von Neumann growth model** is an economic model that describes long-term economic expansion based on productive processes and resource allocation. It connects closely to the general economic terminology we discussed:
                 **Economy** – The von Neumann model represents an economy as a system of interdependent industries where production processes determine economic expansion. The model focuses on achieving a balanced growth rate for the entire economy.
                     **Industry** – The model assumes multiple industries that produce different goods using various production techniques. Each industry contributes to overall economic growth through efficient resource utilization.
                     **Sector** – Different economic sectors interact in the von Neumann model, with some sectors producing raw materials, others manufacturing capital goods, and others providing consumer products. Their interdependence drives economic expansion.
                         **Goods** – Goods in this model include both consumer and capital goods, which industries produce using available resources. Capital goods (such as machines and tools) are particularly important, as they enable further production.
                         **Production** – A key aspect of the von Neumann model is that production relies on inputs (resources and capital) to generate outputs. The model assumes that production functions exhibit constant returns to scale, meaning that output increases proportionally with input.
                         **Cost** – The model incorporates the idea of efficiency, where industries must minimize costs by optimizing input use. It assumes that resources flow to the most productive sectors, ensuring maximum economic growth.
                 In summary, the von Neumann growth model uses mathematical principles to explain how industries, goods, production, and costs interact to drive long-term economic growth. It highlights the importance of efficient resource allocation and technological progress in sustaining economic expansion.
             Background and Motivation of the von Neumann Growth Model #h 
                 The **von Neumann economic growth model** explains how economies optimize resource allocation and technological progress to achieve sustainable expansion, ensuring efficient use and potential **reuse** of goods in a cyclical economic system. #slide
                 Origins #slide #teaching #research 
                     Introduced by John von Neumann in 1937 \cite{}.
                     Initially presented as a mathematical theory of economic growth.
                     Published formally in "A Model of General Economic Equilibrium" in 1945-46 \cite{}.
                     Inspired by early studies on balanced economic expansion and Walrasian general equilibrium theory \cite{}.
                 Basic Economics Terminology #slide 
                     Societies consume resources and capital to produce, distribute, and reuse goods. 
                     Here's how they relate to each other:  
                         economy,
                         sector, 
                         industry, 
                         goods, 
                         production,
                         cost,
                         resources,
                         capital.
                     Societies operate within an **economy**, where different **sectors** (such as agriculture, manufacturing, and technology) consist of various **industries** that produce and distribute **goods**. 
                     These industries rely on **resources** (such as raw materials, labor, and energy) and **capital** (such as machinery, infrastructure, and investments) to drive **production**. 
                     The **cost** of production, including labor and materials, influences pricing and market dynamics. 
                 Economy, Sectors and Industries #slide 
                     Economy is the broader system that encompasses all industries, businesses, and activities related to the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. 
                     It includes everything from agriculture and manufacturing to technology and finance.  
                     Sector refers to a broad division of the economy that groups related industries together, such as the agriculture sector, manufacturing sector, or service sector, each contributing to overall economic activity in different ways.
                     Industry refers to a specific sector of the economy that produces goods or services. For example, the automobile industry produces cars, while the textile industry makes clothing.  
                 Goods, Production and Cost #slide 
                     Goods are physical products that industries produce for consumption or further use. These can range from consumer goods (like clothing and electronics) to capital goods (like machinery used in production).  
                     Production is the process of creating goods and services. It involves using resources such as labour, raw materials, and technology to transform inputs into finished products. The efficiency and scale of production influence the overall performance of industries and the economy.  
                     Cost represents the expenses incurred during production, including raw materials, labour, machinery, and overhead. The cost of production affects pricing, profitability, and competitiveness within an industry and the economy as a whole.  
                 Motivation #slide #teaching #research 
                     Goal: to maximise the growth levels of production, while minimising associated costs.
                         Understanding the dynamics of economic growth:
                             How can economies achieve sustained growth under resource constraints?
                         Capturing production interdependencies:
                             Focuses on the relationships between sectors and goods in an economy.
                     Providing an idealized framework:
                         Assumes perfectly efficient allocation of resources and production.

                 Context and Details
                 If the input and output transformation of a von Neumann production system is an $$F$$-transformation, the von Neumann maximal growth factor $$\rho$$ is the F-eigenvalue, and $$z$$, $$p$$ are the (unique) right and left F-eigenvectors of $$D-\lambda C$$ (\cite{Drandakis1966-nv}).
             Basic Estimates #slide 
                 One has
                     $$\rho \le (\sum a_{ij})/(\sum b_{ij})=\sum a_{ij}/(\sum b_{ij})\le \sum (a_{ij}/b_{ij})$$ (\cite{})

             Rank-1 Models #h 
                 LP Equivalence Theorem #slide 
                     Consider the model VNM($$B,A$$) where $$B=uv^\top \geqq 0$$.
                     We refer to this as a rank-1 VN model.
                     It is known in the literature \cite{Bidard2000-jr}, that such a model is equivalent to a linear program.
                     Theorem: the rank-one model VNM($$uv^\top,A$$) with maximal growth factor $$\lambda>0$$ is equivalent to the linear program LP($$v^\top, A, u$$) with optimal value $$\lambda^{-1}$$. #theorem 
                 Proof #slide 
                     $$\Longrightarrow$$" 
                         We start with $$\lambda$$ maximal such that $$\exists x^\top: x^\top(A-\lambda uv^\top)\geqq 0$$.
                         Define $$\tilde{x} := \frac{x^\top}{\lambda x^\top u}$$.
                         Then $$\tilde{x}u=\frac{x^\top u}{\lambda x^\top u}=\lambda^{-1}$$ is minimal, such that $$\tilde{x}^\top(A-\lambda uv^\top)=\tilde{x}^\top A-v^\top \geqq 0$$.
                         This means that the linear program LP($$u, A, v^\top$$) is solved by $$\tilde{x}^\top$$ with value $$\lambda^{-1}$$.
                     "$$\Longleftarrow$$" 
                         Assume $${x}^\top$$ is a solution of the linear program LP($$u, A, v^\top$$) with value $$\mu^{}$$.
                         This means $$\mu := x^\top u$$ is minimal such that $$x^\top A-v^\top\geqq 0$$.
                         One has $$v^\top=\frac{x^\top u}{x^\top u}v^\top = \frac{1}{x^\top u}x^\top uv^\top = \mu^{-1}x^\top uv^\top \geqq 0$$. 
                         Hence $$x^\top(A-\mu^{-1} uv^\top)\geqq 0$$ and $$\lambda:=\mu^{-1}$$ is a maximal growth factor for VNM($$uv^\top,A$$).

                 Weak and Strong Duality #slide 
                 Example #slide 
                     Consider LP$$(A,b,c)$$ where
                         $$A=\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 3 & -1 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 \\ 3 & 1 & 0 \\  \end{pmatrix},\quad b=\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ 4 \\ 7 \\  \end{pmatrix},\quad^tc=\begin{pmatrix} 5&2&1  \\  \end{pmatrix}$$.
                     This example is given in \cite{Fer} and its value and primal and dual optimal solutions are
                         $$v=\frac{3}{47},\quad {}^tx=\begin{pmatrix} 0&1&5/3  \\  \end{pmatrix},\quad y=\begin{pmatrix} 7/3\\0\\4  \\  \end{pmatrix}$$.
                     Then $$D={}^tc\,b=\begin{pmatrix} 30&12&6 \\ 20&8&4 \\ 35&14&7 \\  \end{pmatrix}$$ and we consider the pencil $$A-\lambda D$$.

                     Deleting the first row and second column, corresponding to the zero components of the optimal solutions, the sub-pencil

                     is obtained.
                     One verifies that
                         $$\mathcal{E}(\hat{A}-\lambda \hat{D})=\left[\hat{v}=\frac{47}{3},\quad {}^t\hat{x}=\begin{pmatrix} 1&5/3  \\  \end{pmatrix},\quad \hat{y}=\begin{pmatrix} 7/3\\4  \\  \end{pmatrix}\right]$$

                         Circular economy:
                             Focuses on minimizing waste and maximizing resource reuse within a closed-loop system.
                         Digital productivity:
                             Refers to the effective use of digital tools, platforms, and processes to create value.
                     Digital productivity exhibits traits of a circular economy #slide 
                         Reuse of digital resources:
                             Digital tools, software, and platforms can be reused indefinitely without degradation.
                             Example: Open-source software reused and adapted across industries.
                         Knowledge as a renewable resource:
                             Knowledge work outputs (e.g., reports, analyses) can be reused as inputs for future projects.
                             Example: Insights from one project informing strategic decisions for others.
                         Low marginal cost of replication:
                             Digital goods (e.g., software, data, reports) can be duplicated at almost zero cost.
                     Conclusion #slide 
                         Digital productivity can be partially seen as a circular economy:
                             Strengths:
                                 The reuse and low-cost replication of digital resources align with circular principles.
                             Limitations:
                                 Energy use and hardware waste are significant barriers to full circularity.
                             Future direction:
                                 Emphasizing green computing and sustainable digital practices can help bridge the gap.
                         Challenges in achieving circularity 
                             Digital waste:
                                 Obsolete hardware, e-waste, and outdated systems contribute to resource inefficiency.
                             Energy consumption:
                                 Data centers and cloud computing require significant energy, impacting sustainability.
                             Security and obsolescence:
                                 Older digital systems may become vulnerable, limiting their long-term reusability.

                             1. For Project 1:
                                 $$            (1 + g)(2x_1 + x_2) \leq 3x_1 + x_2.$$
                             2. For Project 2:
                                 $$            (1 + g)(x_1 + 2x_2) \leq x_1 + 3x_2.$$
                             Solving these yields:
                             $$        g^* = 0.5 \quad \text{(50\% maximum growth rate)}.$$
                         Equilibrium Production Levels #slide 
                             At the maximum growth rate $$ g^* $$, equilibrium production levels satisfy:
                             $$        x_1 = 2 \quad \text{(output from Project 1)}, \quad x_2 = 1 \quad \text{(output from Project 2)}.$$

                             Dual price vector:
                                 $$        p = \begin{bmatrix} p_1 \\ p_2 \end{bmatrix},$$
                                 where $$ p_1 $$ is the value per unit of Report Writing and $$ p_2 $$ is the value per unit of Data Analysis.
                         Interpretation #slide 
                             Inputs ($$ A $$): Project 1 relies more on Report Writing, while Project 2 relies more on Data Analysis.
                             Outputs ($$ B $$):Project 1 emphasizes producing reports; Project 2 emphasizes producing data insights.
                             Maximum Growth Rate ($$ g^* $$):
                                 The tasks can grow at a maximum rate of 50\%, given the balance of inputs and outputs.
                             Equilibrium Values:
                                 Project Outputs: Project 1 should produce twice as much as Project 2.
                                 Task Values: Report Writing is valued twice as much as Data Analysis.

                     A fascinating adaptation of the von Neumann growth model! 
                     Goal: 
                         to apply the model for investing in security measures for a system with interdependent assets and multiple security controls. 
                         This should maximise the cost-benefit utility for the organisation running the system while minimising the financial damage inflicted by an attacker.
                     Let's map the network security scenario to the model's framework:
                         Considering two sectors = LAN and DMZ
                         Networked appliances as goods
                         Security benefits minus deployment costs minus loss of asset value as the utility.
                 Example: A 2x2 Highly Interconnected System #slide #teaching 
                     Model Parameters:
                         Input matrix $$ A $$: Represents resources required for production.
                         Output matrix $$ B $$: Represents resources produced by production.
                         Let
                             $$        A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}, \quad         B = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 1 & 2 \end{bmatrix}.$$
                     Interpretation:
                         Input Matrix $$ A $$:
                             Every unit of output from any sector requires 1 unit of every input.
                         Output Matrix $$ B $$:
                             Sector 1 produces 2 units of Good 1 and 1 unit of Good 2.
                             Sector 2 produces 1 unit of Good 1 and 2 units of Good 2.
                 Example: Independent System #slide #teaching
                     A matrix AA with all entries equal to 1 reflects a system of **uniform interdependence and balanced resource usage**, 
                     which has strong symmetry but also potential vulnerabilities if outputs fail to exceed inputs.
