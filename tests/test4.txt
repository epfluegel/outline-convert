  - The Goals of Computer Security #slide #CI7100 #CI7160-intro #CI7130_Intro #basic #CI6280
    - We will define as the main goals (or requirements) of Computer Security (“CIA”):
      - Confidentiality
      - Integrity
      - Availability
    - This terminology is adopted by academia and industry
    - Note: cannot “guarantee” absolute security
  - Threats, Vulnerabilities and Controls #slide #CI7100 #CI7160-intro #CI7130_Intro #basic #CI6280
    - Threat: set of circumstances with potential to exploit vulnerability and create a risk of harm
    - Vulnerability: potentially exploitable weakness of an asset
    - Attack: realisation of a threat ("threat event")
    - Risk: occurs if “matching” threat and vulnerability exist
    - Control: a mitigation technique, either eliminate the threat and/or close the vulnerability
  - Basic Security Methodology #slide #CI6240_SM-1 #CI7100 #CI7160_D1 #CI7130_Intro #basic #CI6280
    - The basic methodology in computer security is:
      - We detect uncovered vulnerabilities in our system
      - We think about potential threats to our system
      - Finally, we consider available controls (countermeasures)
    - Impossible to guarantee security, can only minimise risk
    - Need for periodic review

- BASIC #linear #basic #wfe-ignore-item
  - Assets #CI7100 #CI7130_Intro #slide #CI7160-intro #basic
    - In order to better understand security attacks, we have to define what we want to protect
    - This is called an asset
    - We categorise assets in the following way:
      - System (logical)
      - Hardware
      - Software
      - Data
      - People
  - Assets #slide #CI7100 #CI7130_Intro #CI6240_SM-1 #basic
    - !assets.png #wfe-style:normal
  - Mini-Exercise: Assets #slide #CI7100 #CI7130_Intro #basic
    - Look around you. There are many assets of the Kingston University system present. List some asset items, with at least one in each category.
    - Which of them do you consider being critical assets -- these would be assets of particular value or importance for your student experience.
  - The Goals of Computer Security #slide #CI7100 #CI7160-intro #CI7130_Intro #basic
    - We will define as the main goals (or requirements) of Computer Security (“CIA”):
      - Confidentiality
      - Integrity
      - Availability
    - This terminology is adopted by academia and industry
    - Note: cannot “guarantee” absolute security
  - Confidentiality #slide #CI7100 #CI7160-intro #CI7130_Intro #basic
    - Definition: computer related assets must be accessed only by authorised parties
    - Synonyms: secrecy, privacy
    - Example: you need to prevent hackers from accessing personal data in your social network account
    - There may be different levels of confidentiality for different users
  - Integrity #slide #CI7100 #CI7160-intro #CI7130_Intro #basic
    - Data Integrity:
      - Data has not been modified by unauthorised parties
      - Example: file transfer, email, computer viruses
    - Origin Integrity (Authentication):
      - We have proof about origin of a message
      - Example: IP address of the machine the e-mail was sent from
    - Non-repudiation:
      - Sender (or recipient) of a message cannot deny having been involved in message transfer
      - This is more complex (usually involves 3 parties)
  - Availability #slide #CI7100 #CI7160-intro #CI7130_Intro #basic
    - Definition: assets are accessible to authorised parties at appropriate times
    - In other words: legitimate access should always be possible
    - Example: a website should be available 24/7.
    - Different availability levels

  - Threats, Vulnerabilities, Attacks and Risks #slide #CI7100 #CI7160-intro #CI7130_Intro #basic
    - Threat: set of circumstances with potential to exploit vulnerability and create a risk of harm
    - Vulnerability: potentially exploitable weakness of an asset
    - Attack: realisation of a threat ("threat event")
    - Risk: occurs if “matching” threat and vulnerability exist
  - Controls #slide #CI7100 #CI7160-intro #CI7130_Intro #basic
    - A control is used for protection.
    - It could be for example an
      - action,
      - procedure,
      - device,
      - technique.
    - It either eliminates the threat and/or closes the vulnerability.
    - Controls need to be effective.
  - #todo Basic Security Methodology #slide #CI6240_SM-1 #CI7100 #CI7160_D1 #CI7130_Intro #basic
    - The basic methodology in computer security is:
      - We detect uncovered vulnerabilities in our system
      - We think about potential threats to our system
      - Finally, we consider available controls (countermeasures)
    - Impossible to guarantee security, can only minimise risk
    - Need for periodic review
  - Generic Security Methodology #slide #CI7160-intro
    - For each critical asset do:
      - Identify potential threats
      - Detect uncovered vulnerabilities
      - Assess potential risks
      - Design controls (countermeasures)
    - Constant re-evaluation is necessary
      - Anticipate potential new threats (for example: http://www.cert.org)
      - Identifies areas where more work is needed
      - Review existing controls
      - Monitor technological progress
  - Mini-Exercise: Security Goals #slide:mini #CI7100 #CI7130_Intro #basic
    - Read the story about the recent security incident at The Register.
    - Analyse the story more in-depth (you may have to research older, related articles) and identify which of the main security goals were violated, and of which (critical) assets.

  - VULNERABILITIES #wfe-ignore-item
    - More About Vulnerabilities #slide #CI7130_Intro #basic
      - Depending on the vulnerable asset type, we can identify:
        - Hardware Vulnerabilities
        - Data Vulnerabilities
        - Software Vulnerabilities
        - People Vulnerabilities
    - Hardware Vulnerabilities #slide #CI7130_Intro
      - Physical Vulnerabilities
        - Hardware is composed of physical objects -- it is simple to add, change, destroy or remove parts.
        - This means that computer devices might be prone to a physical attack.
        - Computers have been stolen, kicked, punched, burnt, frozen, shot at.. the https://youtu.be/algWjS2yiyE) !
        - Before the University tightened its physical controls, every semester at least one projector used to be stolen!
      - Microprocessor Design Flaws
        - Recent huge issue: flaws in Intel/ARM chip design ("Meltdown" and "Spectre")
        - This is actually a combination of hardware and software vulnerabilities
    - Data Vulnerabilities #slide #CI7130_Intro
      - Enormous amounts of data around (big data), connected and exposed to the Internet, and stored on corporate clouds.
      - Data can be human-readable (text) or in binary format.
      - Need to think of data at rest, and in transit (computation/memory, hard disk, network, brain).
      - Data attacks are more widespread than software attacks.
        - Unprotected data is "easy" to read and intrinsically vulnerable to all threat outcomes (interception, interruption, modification).
        - Furthermore, it can be easily duplicated.
    - Software Vulnerabilities #slide #CI7130_Intro
      - Software is also data, so all data vulnerabilities apply
      - Weaknesses can appear during different stages of software development and deployment life cycle:
        - Source Code
          - Coding Flaws: mistakes in the design of source code, weak cryptographic implementations (ignoring standards).
        - Compiled (Binary) Code
          - Inherently vulnerable to malicious exploits (buffer overflow, SQL injection).
          - Expanded attack surface due to frequent use of common libraries.
        - Deployed Application
          - Misconfiguration: weaknesses such as security patches out of date, weak security settings (e.g., default passwords).
      - Software vulnerabilities are indexed in the CVE catalogue on cve.org.
    - People Vulnerabilities #slide #CI7130_Intro
      - People are often the weakest link.
      - Typical exploit: phishing/spam emails.
      - Effectiveness is often underestimated.
      - This is particularly problematic if the targeted people are key individuals within an IT system, such as system administrators or lecturers.
      - Vulnerabilities:
        - Lack of security awareness -- people tend to use computers irresponsibly.
        - Lack of skills, training, and expertise -- not having the technical know-how in security.
        - Personality Weaknesses
          - Laziness and forgetfulness -- writing down or reusing passwords, forgetting to make backups, etc.
          - Naivety -- if this persists despite training, people are an ideal target for social engineering.

      - Revisit again the story about the security incident and identify the main vulnerabilities that were threatened/attacked. To which critical assets do they belong?
  - THREATS AND ATTACKS #wfe-ignore-item
    - More About Threats #slide #CI7130_Intro
      - Threat versus Attack
        - An attack is the implementation of a event (= threat event)
      - Threat Actors
        - Ultimately, security attacks are carried out by real people
        - They have a motive
      - Threat Landscape
      - Threat Profiling
    - Threat Outcomes #slide #CI7130_Intro
      - There are four outcomes, threatening CIA triad:
        - Interception (synonyms: disclosure, evesdropping, snooping) -- unauthorised access to asset
        - Interruption -- an asset becomes unavailable
        - Modification -- tampering with an asset
        - Fabrication -- creation of new objects in a computer system
      - Examples:
        - copying data, stealing a password
        - destroying hardware device, corrupting a file
        - changing values in a database
        - adding records to a database, creating a trap door
    - Threats to Data  #slide #CI7130_Intro
      - Disclosure (Leaking):
        - Doxing -- Stealing data and dumping it on the Internet, such as on PasteBin
        - Credential Stuffing -- get hold of login information, and try it on different accounts
      - Malicious Modification:
        - Deletion -- accidental or deliberate
        - Salami attack -- modify only small amounts of data at a time, but then do this very often, examples:
          - Credit card theft
          - Transferring rounding errors in bank transactions to own account (see movie "Office Space")
        - Ransomware -- encrypt the victim's data, or threaten to publish it, unless a ransom is paid
      - Loss of Ownership
    - Threats and Software #slide #CI7130_Intro
      - Threats to Software
        - Source Code Disclosure: source code can leak, be stolen or reverse engineered
        - Exposure to Virus Infection: executable (binary) code can be modified by a virus
      - Software as Threat
        - Malware: Software that may itself have hidden or open malicious or undesirable side effects, or contain back doors
        - Terminology: Zero-day exploit -- the first attack of a newly found vulnerability (see: Google Project 0)
    - Cyber Threat Actors (Attackers) #slide #CI7130_Intro #new #wfe-ignore-outline
      - White Hat (Ethical) Hackers -- non-malicious attackers employed to find vulnerabilities in an organisation to improve security.
      - Black Hat Hackers (Computer Criminals) -- malicious attackers who want to profit financially.
      - Grey Hat Hackers -- somewhere between White Hat and Black Hat. For example, they might carry out ethical hacking activities without consent.
      - Script Kiddies -- non-malicious but thoughtless and haphazard (teenage) users. Find and run scripted security attacks to be entertained or thrilled.
      - Researchers (Cryptanalysts) -- non-malicious attackers who focus on finding security loopholes offline.
      - Other terms often used: #wfe-ignore-outline
        - Hacktivists: Attack for political or social causes.
        - Cybercriminals: Attack for financial gain.
        - Nation-states: Attack for political, military or economic espionage purposes.
        - Insiders: Attack for revenge, financial gain, or ideology.
        - Script kiddies: Attack for fun or to impress others.
        - Terrorists: Attack for ideological or political reasons.

    - Mini-Exercise: Threats #slide-mini #CI7130_Intro #basic #slide
      - Still for the security incident that you have examined earlier, what were/are the main threats that could be relevant?
  - RISK #wfe-ignore-item
    - Risk #slide #CI7130_Intro
      - Risk occurs if both a threat and a matching vulnerability exist.
      - Risk arises if there is a probability of damage to our assets, arising from an attack
      - Realistic purpose of computer security: minimise risks (rather than achieving complete security)
      - Risk can be modelled, using appropriate risk analysis frameworks, as a function of:
        - (i) the adverse impacts that would arise if the circumstance or event occurs;
        - (ii) the likelihood of occurrence.
    - Risk #slide #CI7130_Intro #CI6240_SM-1 #wfe-ignore-outline
      - !risk.png #wfe-ignore-item
    - Mini-Exercise: Risk #slide-mini #CI7130_Intro #CI6240_SM-1 #basic #slide
      - Revisit the news item about the recent security incident. We had identified critical assets and their relevant threats and vulnerabilities. In your opinion, how big is the risk that an attack might happen in the near future? Justify your answer.
  - CONTROLS #wfe-ignore-item
    - More About Controls #slide #CI7130_Intro #basic
      - A control is an action, procedure, device or a technique used for protection. #control
      - We can discuss controls by considering the following aspects:
        - Design principle -- principle of the mitigation technique
        - Implementation -- how the control is realised
        - Strength -- how successful they might protect against attacks
        - Effectiveness -- to what extent they reach their full potential strength
        - Strategy -- how they are strategically designed, in a hostile environment
    - Controls -- Design principle #slide #CI7130_Intro #basic
      - Preventative or proactive control:
        - Preempt -- by blocking the attack, neutralising the threat, closing the vulnerability, or all of it
        - Deter -- by making the attack harder
        - Deflect -- by making another target more attractive
      - Detective control:
        - Detect the attack -- either as it happens or sometime afterwards
      - Reactive control:
        - Corrective or retrospective control: recover from the effect of an attack
    - Controls -- Implementation #slide #CI7130_Intro
      - Physical (Traditional) Controls -- e.g. guards, locks, backup copies
      - Hardware Controls -- e.g. certain types of firewalls, smartcards, hardware authenticators
      - Software Controls -- e.g. encryption, protection in operating systems, protocols, virus scanners, security patches
      - Administrative Controls -- e.g. security policies or security assessment frameworks used in an organisation, training, nudging
    - Controls -- Strength #slide #CI7130_Intro
      - Principle of Overlapping Control (Layered Defense)
        - Controls can be strengthened by using overlapping controls
        - Example: in a computer lab, use swipe cards and locks attached to projectors
      - Principle of Adequate Protection
        - Assets relate to cost -- strenght of protection should be consistent with the asset value
        - They might lose their value after some time -- only protect until loss of value
    - Controls -- Effectiveness #slide #CI7130_Intro
      - Principle of Effectiveness
        - No control is 100% safe -- quality of control will have impact on losses due to attacks
        - Controls are only effective, if they are used
        - Many users are unaware of need for security/unwilling to cooperate
        - Notion of "security theatre"
      - Examples
        - Detection rate of IDS
        - Comprehensiveness of firewall rules
        - Quality of software update policy
        - Who ever changes his/her passwords?
        - Are the swipe cards for our computer labs effective?
    - Controls -- Strategy #slide #CI7130_Intro
      - Principle of Weakest Link
        - A control can be no stronger than its weakest component
        - Example: we set up an elaborate firewall for the network, but forget to protect a wireless access point
      - Principle of Easiest Attack
        - The attacker will find the for him easiest loophole, not necessarily the most obvious one!
        - Example: spear-phishing
      - Principle of Periodic Review
        - Periodic review and re-evaluation is necessary to ensure the sustained effectiveness of a control
        - Example: re-imaging lab computers during term break
    - Should A Control Be A Worry-Eater? #slide #CI7130_Intro
      - ![worry-eater.jpg #fix
      - It should not! Actions:
        - Monitor technological progress and anticipate potential new threats, for example of the CERT Website
        - Identifies areas where more work is needed on the system
        - Example: technicians revisit the computer labs at the end of the semester
    - Recent Controls #slide
      - Companies routinely use DDos attack mitigation services (Akami) to form a "Smokescreen"
      - Initiatives for financial sector: CBEST
      - In the UK, the Digital Economy Act, passed in April 2017, bans citizens' access to perfectly legal websites that don't meet its requirements.

      - Revisit the security incident article one last time.
      - Which are the controls, that either would have prevented the attack, or that are necessary to be put in place? How effective might they be?
      - Can you identify which of the principles regarding the strength, effectiveness and strategic use of your controls might be most relevant or applicable?
    - Schneier's Law #todo
- TREE #tree #basic #wfe-ignore-outline
  - V1 #tree
    - The basic methodology in computer security is to first think about potential weaknesses in a given system.
      - [COMPLETE] In order to better understand these security weaknesses, we have to define what we want to protect -- this is called an asset.
        - [COMPLETE] We can categorise assets based on their technical nature, but we also include the human factor.
          - System (logical) assets
          - Hardware assets
          - Software assets
          - Data assets
          - People assets
        - [COMPLETE] Another distinction can be made between tangible and intangible assets.
          - Intangible assets include
            - patents
            - copyrights
            - franchises
            - goodwill
            - trademarks
            - trade names
            - reputation
        - [COMPLETE] Assets that are crucial for our system (or its users) are referred to as critical assets.
        - [COMPLETE] A target is an asset under attack.
        - [COMPLETE] Mini-Exercise: Assets #CI7130_Intro
          - Look around you. There are many assets of the Kingston University system present. List at least 15 asset items, with 3 of each category.
          - Which of them do you consider being critical assets – these would be assets of particular value or importance for your student experience.
      - Assets have fundamental security requirements.
        - We will introduce the main goals (or requirements) of Computer Security (“CIA triad”) as the de facto standard.
          - Confidentiality -- only authorised parties have access to our assets
            - Confidentiality: the requirement of keeping an asset inaccessible to unauthorized parties
            - Definition: computer related assets must be accessed only by authorised parties
            - Synonyms: secrecy, privacy
            - Example: you need to prevent hackers from accessing personal data in your social network account
          - Integrity -- assets have not been modified by unauthorised parties
            - Data Integrity
            - Origin Integrity (Authentication)
            - Non-Repudiation
            - Integrity #CI7130_Intro
              - Data Integrity:
                - Data has not been modified by unauthorised parties
                - Example: file transfer, email, computer viruses
              - Origin Integrity (Authentication):
                - We have proof about origin of a message
                - Example: IP address of the machine the e-mail was sent from
              - Non-repudiation:
                - Sender cannot deny having sent a message.
                - Example: email, logging on to a system
            - Integrity: the authenticity, accuracy, and completeness of an asset
              - Data Integrity
              - Origin Integrity (Authentication)
              - Non-repudiation
          - Availability -- assets are available to authorised parties at appropriate times
            - Availability #CI7130_Intro
              - Definition: assets are accessible to authorised parties at appropriate times
              - In other words: legitimate access should always be possible
              - Example: a website should be available 24/d, 7/w. And so should be the universities e-mail system
              - Lack of availability can be desirable, too.
              - Anonymity is withhelding identifying information
              - Is increasingly becoming an important goal
            - Availability: assets are accessible and usable on demand by authorised parties
          - Illustration
        - Implementing these security goals is a non-trivial task.
          - Many people can have access to the system.
          - There may be different levels of security
            - Different availability levels: object or service is available if it is usable, making clear progress or the service completes in an acceptable period of time
          - We need to be able to do
            - User authentication
            - Access control
            - Data protection/encryption
        - Refinements are possible for more specific circumstances and scenarios.
          - For many scenarios, we can also find additional security goals
          - They are effectively refinements of the main CIA goals
          - Examples:
            - Anonymity -- information relating to the sender of a message must not be available to non-authorised parties
            - Invisibility/Undetectability -- confidential information contained in a message must not be detectable or raise suspicion (steganography) #stego
            - Fair Use
        - Let's do the following Mini-Exercise: CIA
          - Revisit the story about the security incident.
          - Analyse the story more in detail and identify which of the main security goals were violated, and of which (critical) assets. Justify your answers.
          - Write down 12 assets that you can identify around you, 3 for each asset type. Whenever possible, try to find the CPE classes.
            "http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsNISTIRs.html"
      - A vulnerability is a potentially exploitable weakness ("loophole") of an asset.
        - When preparing to specify, design, code or test a secure system, we need to be aware of its differential potential vulnerabilities
          - Hardware Vulnerabilities
            - Hardware is composed of physical objects
            - It is simple to add, change or remove devices
            - This means that computer device might be prone to a physical attack
            - Computers have been kicked, punched, burnt, frozen, shot at..
            - The proof: https://youtu.be/algWjS2yiyE
            - Before the University tightened its physical controls, every semester at least one projector used to be stolen!
          - Software Vulnerabilities
            - Software weaknesses are in two types of software:
              - Source code
                - Source code can be stolen/reverse engineered
                - Coding Flaws/Bugs, potentially leading to malicious exploits
                - Frequent use of common libraries amplifies the problem
                - Flaws are indexed in the CVE catalog
              - Executable (object) code
                - Code can be modified by a virus
                - Illegally downloading files from the Internet is theft, too
                - Back doors
            - Another important examples is misconfiguration, e.g. patches are out of date.
          - Data Vulnerabilities
            - Very similar problems as with software, but data attacks are more widespread than software attacks as data “easier” to read, and enormous amounts  of data around (big data)
            - Need to think of data at rest, and in transit (computation, network..)
          - People Vulnerabilities
            - Lack of security awareness -- people tend to forget things, make mistakes and use computers irresponsibly
              - Write down passwords, forget to make backups etc.
            - Naïvity of many computer users makes an ideal target for social engineering
              - This is particularly problematic if targeted people are key people within an IT system, e.g. system administrators, lecturers..
              - Typical exploit: phishing/spam emails
              - Effectiveness is often underestimated
        - Vulnerability Chaining
        - Mini-Exercise: Vulnerabilities
          - Revisit again the story about the security incident and identify the main vulnerabilities that were threatened/attacked.
      - The analysis of vulnerabilities alone does not give us any indications about ipossible exploitation by an attack.
      - A threat is a set of circumstances with potential to exploit a vulnerability and create harm to assets.
        - Threats #CI7130_Intro
        - This could be a violation of security, or otherwise unwanted incident, which may result in harm to a system/organisation/user
        - Can be further characterised by additional attributes (see OCTAVE security assessment framework)
        - Threat Landscape: typical, currently relevant threats
        - Threat Modelling: identification and profiling of relevant threats
        - Mini-Exercise: Threats #CI7130_Intro
          - Still for the security incident that you have examined earlier, what were/are the main threats that could be relevant?
    - This is followed by the design of suitable controls (countermeasures) in order to mitigate attacks.
      - An attack is the implementation of a threat.
        - ATTACKS #concept #attack
          - Attack -- Terminology #CI7130_Intro
            - An attack implements a threat to an asset (target), carried out by an attacker with a certain (malicious) motive
            - This needs to have a matching vulnerability
            - An attack vector is the access path to the asset under threat
            - The attack surface of a system or software is exposed to attacks
            - A zero-day attack (or exploit) is the first attack on a new vulnerability
            - Attacker have multiple types and motives
          - Examples of Typical Attacks #attack #CI7130_Intro
            - Denial of Service (DoS) Attack
            - Spoofing Attack, Man-in-the-Middle Attack
            - Social Engineering Attack, Phishing Attack
            - Credential Stealing
            - Buffer Overflow Attack, SQL Injection Attack, XSS Attack
            - Infection with Computer Virus, Running Malware
            - Disclosure of Personal Information
          - CRYPTANALYSIS #attack #CI7100
            - Cryptography vs Cryptanalysis
              - Cryptography - the science of encryption
              - Cryptanalysis - break an encryption scheme. Several strategies:
                - Recognise patterns in encrypted messages
                - Deduce the key
                - Infer some meaning without even breaking the encryption
              - Breakable encryption - analyst can determine the algorithm (given enough time and data)
              - Cryptology is cryptography and cryptanalysis
            - Ciphertext Attacks #attack
              - Ciphertext only – attacker has only copy of the ciphertext
              - Known plaintext – attacker has copy of ciphertext and corresponding plaintext
              - Chosen plaintext – encryption algorithm is accessible, but key not available
              - Chosen ciphertext – access to decryption algorithm, trying to deduce the key
            - Cryptography - Security
              - In descending order of importance:
                - Protocol
                - Encryption method
                - Key length
              - More security normally means slower and more resource hungry
              - Depends on random numbers
              - Public-key algorithms inherently need bigger key sizes than (symmetric) block ciphers
            - Algorithms - Security
              - Level of security only need be as much as is required
              - Worth of information - not worth spending £1000 to get £5 of information
            - Differential and Integral Cryptanalysis
          - Network Attacks #attack #CI7130
            - They can target network links, nodes and protocols
            - Active/passive
            - External/internal
            - Mobile/stationary
            - Outsider/insider

            - Internal Attack #slides
          - OUTCOMES #concept
            - Outcomes of an Attack on an Asset #CI7130_Intro
              - Many things can go wrong: attempt to destroy, expose, alter, disable, steal or gain unauthorised access to or make unauthorised use of an asset
              - Outcomes Classification:
                - Interception (synonym: disclosure) – unauthorised access to asset
                - Interruption – an asset becomes unavailable
                - Modification – tampering with an asset
                - Fabrication – creation of new objects in a computer system
              - Examples:
                - copying data, stealing a password
                - destroying hardware device, corrupting a file
                - changing values in a database
                - adding records to a database, creating a trap door
        - Data Attacks #attack
          - Deletion
            - Can be accidental or deliberate
            - The former probably happened to all of us at least once in our careers
          - Modification
            - Can be done more easily than for software
            - Example: salami attack #GT
              - Idea: modify only small amounts of data at a time, but then do this very often
              - E.g. transferring rounding errors in bank transactions to own account (see movie “Office Space”)
              - Or: credit card scams
        - MOBILE ATTACKS #attack #CI7160 #proto #slide
          - Mobile Attackers
            - In the context of (wireless) networks
            - Attacker can move from node to node
          - Byzantine Attackers
            - Most destructive type of attack
            - Attacker can completely take over a node/host
          - Packet drop attack
            - Black hole
            - Grey hole
          - Attacks on MANETs
        - Quantum Channel Attacks #attack #quantum #CI6240_quantum #slide
          - Eavesdropping (passive) -- detectable

          - OCTAVE Classification
      - A control is an action, procedure, device or a technique used for protection. #control
        - Controls -- Types @NIST2010
          - Depends on the organisation's enterprise architecture and information security architecture
            - System-specified controls -- controls that provides security capability for a particular information system only
            - Common controls -- controls that provides security capability for multiple information system
            - Hybrid controls -- combination of both previous types
        - Controls -- Overview #CI7130_Intro
          - We can discuss controls by considering the following aspects:
            - Technique -- principle of the mitigation technique
            - Implementation -- how the control is realised
            - Strength -- how successful they protect against attacks
            - Effectiveness -- to what extent they reach their full potential strength
            - Strategy -- how they are strategically designed, in a hostile environment
        - Controls -- Technique #CI7130_Intro
          - Controls try to protect the system by neutralising the threat, closing the vulnerability, or both
          - Preventative or proactive control:
            - Preempt – by blocking the attack or closing the vulnerability
            - Deter – by making the attack harder
            - Deflect – by making another target more attractive
          - Detective control: detect attack – either as it happens or sometime after the attack
          - Corrective or retrospective control: recover from the effect of an attack
        - Controls -- Implementation #CI7130_Intro
          - Physical (Traditional) Controls -- e.g. guards, locks, backup copies
          - Hardware Controls -- e.g. certain types of firewalls, smartcards
          - Software Controls -- e.g. encryption, protection in operating systems, virus scanners
          - Administrative Controls -- e.g. security policies or security assessment frameworks used in an organisation, nudging
        - Strength/Effectiveness of a Control
          - Motivation
            - No control is 100% safe
            - Quality of control will have impact on losses due to attacks
          - We define the strength of a control \(\gamma\) as the quotient of the recovered server value \(R_i\) and the damage level \(L_i\): \[ l(\gamma)_i = R_i / L_i \in [0,1], \]
          - Examples
            - Detection rate of IDS
            - Comprehensiveness of firewall rules
            - Quality of software update policy
        - Controls -- Strength #CI7130_Intro
          - Principle of Overlapping Control (Layered Defense)
            - Controls can be strengthened by using overlapping controls
            - Example: in a computer lab, use swipe cards and locks attached to projectors
          - Principle of Adequate Protection
            - Assets relate to cost -- strenght of protection should be consistent with the asset value
            - They might lose their value after some time -- only protect until loss of value
        - Controls -- Effectiveness #CI7130_Intro
          - Principle of Effectiveness
            - Controls are only effective, if they are used
            - Many users are unaware of need for security/unwilling to cooperate
            - Examples: Who ever changes his/her passwords? Are the swipe cards for our computer labs effective?
            - Effectiveness of a control $c$: #GT #hide
              - \[
                - \epsilon_i(c) = R_i(a) / L_i(a) \in [0,1],
              - \]
          - Should a control be a worry-eater?
            "
            ![](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5xwonv6qeufgpnc/worry-eater.jpg?dl=1)"
          - Principle of Sustainability (Periodic Review) #CI7130_Intro
            - Periodic review and re-evaluation is necessary to ensure the sustained effectiveness of a control
            - Monitor technological progress and anticipate potential new threats, for example: http://www.cert.org
            - Identifies areas where more work is needed on the system
            - Example: technicians revisit the computer labs at the end of the semester
        - Controls -- Strategy #GT #CI7130_Intro
          - Principle of Weakest Link
            - A control can be no stronger than its weakest component
            - Example: we set up an elaborate firewall for the network, but forget to protect a wireless access point
          - Principle of Easiest Attack
            - The attacker will find the for him easiest loophole, not necessarily the most obvious one!
        - Mini-Exercise: Controls #CI7130_Intro
          - Revisit the security incident article one last time.
          - Can you devise appropriate controls?
          - Can you identify which of the principles regarding the strength, effectiveness and strategic use of your controls might be most relevant or applicable?
        - VULNERABILITY SCANNING
          - Run tool
          - Identify vulnerabilities in catalogue (ie CVE)
          - Look up CVSS scores and rank
          - Protect agains most severe ones
    - It is important to note however that it is impossible to guarantee absolute security -- we can only hope to reduce risk.
      - Risk occurs if both a threat and a matching vulnerability exist.
        "#concept"
        - Risk #CI7130_Intro
          - Risk arises if there is a probability of damage to our assets, arising from an attack
          - The attack will target our vulnerabilities
          - Realistic purpose of computer security: minimise risks (rather than achieving complete security)
          - Risk can be modelled, using appropriate risk analysis frameworks
      - EXAMPLE
        "#CI7130_Intro"
        - Consider a web site, running on a Web server which is running an old software version
        - Vulnerabilities:
          - Security holes in the Web server software
          - The fact that security patches have not been applied
        - Threats:
          - Scripts (malware) which could exploit security holes
          - Hackers who are eager to compromise systems
        - Risks:
          - Loss of data
          - Bad publicity
          - Downtime
          - Costs (money)
        - Controls:
          - Update server software
          - Monitor the system
          - Install a firewall
      - Mini-Exercise: Security Terminology #CI7160_D1 #slide
        - Refer back to the news item about a recent security breach. Analyse the story more in depth (you may have to research older, related articles) and identify which of the main security goals were violated, and of which (critical) assets.
        - For one critical asset of your choice, list the vulnerabilities that were affected during this incident.
        - Could you think of suitable controls, that would have prevented the attack?

          - System (logical) assets
          - Hardware assets
          - Software assets
          - Data assets
          - People assets
        - [COMPLETE] Another distinction can be made between tangible and intangible assets.
          - Intangible assets include
            - patents
            - copyrights
            - franchises
            - goodwill
            - trademarks
            - trade names
            - reputation
        - [COMPLETE] Assets that are crucial for our system (or its users) are referred to as critical assets.
        - [COMPLETE] A target is an asset under attack.
        - [COMPLETE] Mini-Exercise: Assets #CI7130_Intro
          - Look around you. There are many assets of the Kingston University system present. List at least 15 asset items, with 3 of each category.
          - Which of them do you consider being critical assets – these would be assets of particular value or importance for your student experience.
      - Assets have fundamental security requirements. #youtube #hh
        - We will introduce the main goals (or requirements) of Computer Security (“CIA triad”) as the de facto standard.
        - [COMPLETE] Confidentiality -- only authorised parties have access to our assets. #youtube #hhh
          - Confidentiality: the requirement of keeping an asset inaccessible to unauthorized parties
          - Definition: computer related assets must be accessed only by authorised parties
          - Synonyms: secrecy, privacy
          - Example: you need to prevent hackers from accessing personal data in your social network account
        - [COMPLETE] Integrity -- assets have not been modified by unauthorised parties. #youtube #hhh
          - Data Integrity
          - Origin Integrity (Authentication)
          - Non-Repudiation
          - Integrity #CI7130_Intro
            - Data Integrity:
              - Data has not been modified by unauthorised parties
              - Example: file transfer, email, computer viruses
            - Origin Integrity (Authentication):
              - We have proof about origin of a message
              - Example: IP address of the machine the e-mail was sent from
            - Non-repudiation:
              - Sender cannot deny having sent a message.
              - Example: email, logging on to a system
          - Integrity: the authenticity, accuracy, and completeness of an asset
            - Data Integrity
            - Origin Integrity (Authentication)
            - Non-repudiation
        - [COMPLETE] Availability -- assets are available to authorised parties at appropriate times. #youtube #hhh
          - Availability #CI7130_Intro
            - Definition: assets are accessible to authorised parties at appropriate times
            - In other words: legitimate access should always be possible
            - Example: a website should be available 24/d, 7/w. And so should be the universities e-mail system
            - Lack of availability can be desirable, too.
            - Anonymity is withhelding identifying information
            - Is increasingly becoming an important goal
          - Availability: assets are accessible and usable on demand by authorised parties
        - Illustration: security is CIA #youtube #hhh
        - Implementing these security goals is a non-trivial task.
          - Many people can have access to the system.
          - There may be different levels of security
            - Different availability levels: object or service is available if it is usable, making clear progress or the service completes in an acceptable period of time
          - We need to be able to do
            - User authentication
            - Access control
            - Data protection/encryption
        - Refinements are possible for more specific circumstances and scenarios.
          - For many scenarios, we can also find additional security goals
          - They are effectively refinements of the main CIA goals
          - Examples:
            - Anonymity -- information relating to the sender of a message must not be available to non-authorised parties
            - Invisibility/Undetectability -- confidential information contained in a message must not be detectable or raise suspicion (steganography) #stego
            - Fair Use
        - Let's do the following Mini-Exercise: CIA
          - Revisit the story about the security incident.
          - Analyse the story more in detail and identify which of the main security goals were violated, and of which (critical) assets. Justify your answers.
          - Write down 12 assets that you can identify around you, 3 for each asset type. Whenever possible, try to find the CPE classes.

      - [COMPLETE] A vulnerability is a potentially exploitable weakness ("loophole") of an asset. #youtube #hh
        - When preparing to specify, design, code or test a secure system, we need to be aware of its differential potential vulnerabilities
          - Hardware Vulnerabilities
            - Hardware is composed of physical objects
            - It is simple to add, change or remove devices
            - This means that computer device might be prone to a physical attack
            - Computers have been kicked, punched, burnt, frozen, shot at..
            - The proof: https://youtu.be/algWjS2yiyE
            - Before the University tightened its physical controls, every semester at least one projector used to be stolen!
          - Software Vulnerabilities
            - Software weaknesses are in two types of software:
              - Source code
                - Source code can be stolen/reverse engineered
                - Coding Flaws/Bugs, potentially leading to malicious exploits
                - Frequent use of common libraries amplifies the problem
                - Flaws are indexed in the CVE catalog
              - Executable (object) code
                - Code can be modified by a virus
                - Illegally downloading files from the Internet is theft, too
                - Back doors
            - Another important examples is misconfiguration, e.g. patches are out of date.
          - Data Vulnerabilities
            - Very similar problems as with software, but data attacks are more widespread than software attacks as data “easier” to read, and enormous amounts  of data around (big data)
            - Need to think of data at rest, and in transit (computation, network..)
          - People Vulnerabilities
            - Lack of security awareness -- people tend to forget things, make mistakes and use computers irresponsibly
              - Write down passwords, forget to make backups etc.
            - Naïvity of many computer users makes an ideal target for social engineering
              - This is particularly problematic if targeted people are key people within an IT system, e.g. system administrators, lecturers..
              - Typical exploit: phishing/spam emails
              - Effectiveness is often underestimated
        - Vulnerability Chaining
        - Mini-Exercise: Vulnerabilities
          - Revisit again the story about the security incident and identify the main vulnerabilities that were threatened/attacked.
      - The analysis of vulnerabilities alone does not give us any indications about possible exploitation by an attack.
      - [COMPLETE] A threat is a set of circumstances with potential to exploit a vulnerability and create harm to assets. #youtube #hh
        - Threats #CI7130_Intro
        - This could be a violation of security, or otherwise unwanted incident, which may result in harm to a system/organisation/user
        - Can be further characterised by additional attributes (see OCTAVE security assessment framework)
        - Threat Landscape: typical, currently relevant threats
        - Threat Modelling: identification and profiling of relevant threats
        - Mini-Exercise: Threats #CI7130_Intro
          - Still for the security incident that you have examined earlier, what were/are the main threats that could be relevant?
    - [COMPLETE] This is followed by the design of suitable controls (countermeasures) in order to mitigate attacks. #youtube #h
      - [COMPLETE] An attack is the implementation of a threat. #youtube #hh
        - ATTACKS #concept #attack
          - Attack -- Terminology #CI7130_Intro
            - An attack implements a threat to an asset (target), carried out by an attacker with a certain (malicious) motive
            - This needs to have a matching vulnerability
            - An attack vector is the access path to the asset under threat
            - The attack surface of a system or software is exposed to attacks
            - A zero-day attack (or exploit) is the first attack on a new vulnerability
            - Attacker have multiple types and motives
          - Examples of Typical Attacks #attack #CI7130_Intro
            - Denial of Service (DoS) Attack
            - Spoofing Attack, Man-in-the-Middle Attack
            - Social Engineering Attack, Phishing Attack
            - Credential Stealing
            - Buffer Overflow Attack, SQL Injection Attack, XSS Attack
            - Infection with Computer Virus, Running Malware
            - Disclosure of Personal Information
          - CRYPTANALYSIS #attack #CI7100
            - Cryptography vs Cryptanalysis
              - Cryptography - the science of encryption
              - Cryptanalysis - break an encryption scheme. Several strategies:
                - Recognise patterns in encrypted messages
                - Deduce the key
                - Infer some meaning without even breaking the encryption
              - Breakable encryption - analyst can determine the algorithm (given enough time and data)
              - Cryptology is cryptography and cryptanalysis
            - Ciphertext Attacks #attack
              - Ciphertext only – attacker has only copy of the ciphertext
              - Known plaintext – attacker has copy of ciphertext and corresponding plaintext
              - Chosen plaintext – encryption algorithm is accessible, but key not available
              - Chosen ciphertext – access to decryption algorithm, trying to deduce the key
            - Cryptography - Security
              - In descending order of importance:
                - Protocol
                - Encryption method
                - Key length
              - More security normally means slower and more resource hungry
              - Depends on random numbers
              - Public-key algorithms inherently need bigger key sizes than (symmetric) block ciphers
            - Algorithms - Security
              - Level of security only need be as much as is required
              - Worth of information - not worth spending £1000 to get £5 of information
              - INBOX #new
                - Types of Attacks on Encryption Schemes
                  - Ciphertext-only Attack (COA)
                    - Adversary only has access to ciphertexts.
                    - Goal: Infer plaintext or key from ciphertext.
                  - Known Plaintext Attack (KPA)
                    - Adversary has some pairs of plaintext and corresponding ciphertext.
                    - Leverages known mappings to find the key or decrypt other ciphertexts.
                  - Chosen Plaintext Attack (CPA)
                    - Adversary can choose plaintexts and obtain corresponding ciphertexts.
                    - Used to learn about the encryption algorithm or key.
                  - Chosen Ciphertext Attack (CCA)
                    - Adversary can choose ciphertexts and see corresponding plaintexts.
                    - Helps in learning weaknesses in decryption to retrieve the key.
                - Advanced Attacks on Encryption Schemes
                  - Adaptive Chosen Plaintext Attack (Adaptive CPA)
                    - Adversary chooses new plaintexts based on prior responses.
                    - Aims to adaptively refine knowledge of the key or encryption method.
                  - Adaptive Chosen Ciphertext Attack (Adaptive CCA)
                    - Adversary chooses ciphertexts adaptively based on previous decrypted responses.
                    - Commonly used to exploit decryption oracle weaknesses.
                  - Side-Channel Attack
                    - Exploits physical information like timing or power consumption.
                    - Often bypasses mathematical defenses by targeting hardware.
                  - Brute Force Attack
                    - Tries all possible keys until the correct one is found.
                    - Generally impractical for strong encryption due to high computational cost.
          - ATTACKS ON HASHES #attack #CI7100
            - Cryptanalysis of Hashes
              - Preimage attack:
                - Given x’, find x such that h(x) = x’
                - Can only be done using brute force search (2L attempts)
              - Second preimage attack
                - Given x, find y such that h(x) = h(y)
              - Collision attack:
                - Find x,y with x ≠ y such that h(x)=h(y)
                - Brute-force search requires on average “only” 2L/2 attempts
            - Birthday Paradox
            - MD5 Vulnerabilities
              - Several flaws were found (1996, 2004, 2007)
              - 2007: systematic construction of collision shown:  for any given string of characters X, two colliding files can be found with both begin with X
              - “Rainbow Tables” are accessible online, can be used to reverse MD5 hashes
                - Prevention: use “salt”
              - Googling can be used as (limited) tool for reverse lookup
              - However, preimage attacks are still difficult to carry out
            - Mini-Exercise
              - Consider a situation where an eavesdropper Eve might intercept the data sent by Alice during the authentication process as in the previous example.
              - What are possible attacks that Eve could carry out to compromise the authentication mechanism?
          - Network Attacks #attack #CI7130
            - They can target network links, nodes and protocols
            - Active/passive
            - External/internal
            - Mobile/stationary
            - Outsider/insider

          - OUTCOMES #concept
            - Outcomes of an Attack on an Asset #CI7130_Intro
              - Many things can go wrong: attempt to destroy, expose, alter, disable, steal or gain unauthorised access to or make unauthorised use of an asset
              - Outcomes Classification:
                - Interception (synonym: disclosure) – unauthorised access to asset
                - Interruption – an asset becomes unavailable
                - Modification – tampering with an asset
                - Fabrication – creation of new objects in a computer system
              - Examples:
                - copying data, stealing a password
                - destroying hardware device, corrupting a file
                - changing values in a database
                - adding records to a database, creating a trap door
        - Data Attacks #attack
          - Deletion
            - Can be accidental or deliberate
            - The former probably happened to all of us at least once in our careers
          - Modification
            - Can be done more easily than for software
            - Example: salami attack #GT
              - Idea: modify only small amounts of data at a time, but then do this very often
              - E.g. transferring rounding errors in bank transactions to own account (see movie “Office Space”)
              - Or: credit card scams

          - OCTAVE Classification
      - [COMPLETE] A control is an action, procedure, device or a technique used for protection. #youtube #hh
        - Controls -- Types @NIST2010
          - Depends on the organisation's enterprise architecture and information security architecture
            - System-specified controls -- controls that provides security capability for a particular information system only
            - Common controls -- controls that provides security capability for multiple information system
            - Hybrid controls -- combination of both previous types
        - Controls -- Overview #CI7130_Intro
          - We can discuss controls by considering the following aspects:
            - Technique -- principle of the mitigation technique
            - Implementation -- how the control is realised
            - Strength -- how successful they protect against attacks
            - Effectiveness -- to what extent they reach their full potential strength
            - Strategy -- how they are strategically designed, in a hostile environment
        - Controls -- Technique #CI7130_Intro
          - Controls try to protect the system by neutralising the threat, closing the vulnerability, or both
          - Preventative or proactive control:
            - Preempt – by blocking the attack or closing the vulnerability
            - Deter – by making the attack harder
            - Deflect – by making another target more attractive
          - Detective control: detect attack – either as it happens or sometime after the attack
          - Corrective control: recover from the effect of an attack
        - Controls -- Implementation #CI7130_Intro
          - Physical (Traditional) Controls -- e.g. guards, locks, backup copies
          - Hardware Controls -- e.g. certain types of firewalls, smartcards
          - Software Controls -- e.g. encryption, protection in operating systems, virus scanners
          - Administrative Controls -- e.g. security policies or security assessment frameworks used in an organisation, nudging
        - Strength/Effectiveness of a Control
          - Motivation
            - No control is 100% safe
            - Quality of control will have impact on losses due to attacks
          - We define the strength of a control \(\gamma\) as the quotient of the recovered server value \(R_i\) and the damage level \(L_i\): \[ l(\gamma)_i = R_i / L_i \in [0,1], \]
          - Examples
            - Detection rate of IDS
            - Comprehensiveness of firewall rules
            - Quality of software update policy
        - Controls -- Strenght #CI7130_Intro
          - Principle of Overlapping Control (Layered Defense)
            - Controls can be strengthened by using overlapping controls
            - Example: in a computer lab, use swipe cards and locks attached to projectors
          - Principle of Adequate Protection
            - Assets relate to cost -- strenght of protection should be consistent with the asset value
            - They might lose their value after some time -- only protect until loss of value
        - Controls -- Effectiveness #CI7130_Intro
          - Principle of Effectiveness
            - Controls are only effective, if they are used
            - Many users are unaware of need for security/unwilling to cooperate
            - Examples: Who ever changes his/her passwords? Are the swipe cards for our computer labs effective?
            - Effectiveness of a control $c$: #GT #hide
              - \[
                - \epsilon_i(c) = R_i(a) / L_i(a) \in [0,1],
              - \]
          - Should a control be a worry-eater?

            - Identifies areas where more work is needed on the system
            - Example: technicians revisit the computer labs at the end of the semester
        - Controls -- Strategy #GT #CI7130_Intro
          - Principle of Weakest Link
            - A control can be no stronger than its weakest component
            - Example: we set up an elaborate firewall for the network, but forget to protect a wireless access point
          - Principle of Easiest Attack
            - The attacker will find the for him easiest loophole, not necessarily the most obvious one!
        - Mini-Exercise: Controls #CI7130_Intro
          - Revisit the security incident article one last time.
          - Can you devise appropriate controls?
          - Can you identify which of the principles regarding the strength, effectiveness and strategic use of your controls might be most relevant or applicable?
        - VULNERABILITY SCANNING
          - Run tool
          - Identify vulnerabilities in catalogue (ie CVE)
          - Look up CVSS scores and rank
          - Protect agains most severe ones
    - [COMPLETE] It is important to note however that it is impossible to guarantee absolute security -- we can only hope to reduce risk. #youtube #h
      - Risk occurs if both a threat and a matching vulnerability exist.
        "#concept"
        - Risk #CI7130_Intro
          - Risk arises if there is a probability of damage to our assets, arising from an attack
          - The attack will target our vulnerabilities
          - Realistic purpose of computer security: minimise risks (rather than achieving complete security)
          - Risk can be modelled, using appropriate risk analysis frameworks
      - EXAMPLE
        "#CI7130_Intro"
        - Consider a web site, running on a Web server which is running an old software version
        - Vulnerabilities:
          - Security holes in the Web server software
          - The fact that security patches have not been applied
        - Threats:
          - Scripts (malware) which could exploit security holes
          - Hackers who are eager to compromise systems
        - Risks:
          - Loss of data
          - Bad publicity
          - Downtime
          - Costs (money)
        - Controls:
          - Update server software
          - Monitor the system
          - Install a firewall
      - Mini-Exercise: Security Terminology #CI7160_D1 #slide
        - Refer back to the news item about a recent security breach. Analyse the story more in depth (you may have to research older, related articles) and identify which of the main security goals were violated, and of which (critical) assets.
        - For one critical asset of your choice, list the vulnerabilities that were affected during this incident.
        - Could you think of suitable controls, that would have prevented the attack?

    - #note
      - CS is such a broad topic - huge advances - but how does it work in principle? This is more or less always the same approach.
  - V3 - YouTube final #tree
    - The basic methodology in computer security is to first think about potential weaknesses in a given system.
      - In order to better understand these security weaknesses, we have to define what we want to protect -- this is called an asset.
      - Assets have fundamental security requirements.
        - Confidentiality -- only authorised parties have access to our assets.
        - Integrity -- assets have not been modified by unauthorised parties.
        - Availability -- assets are available to authorised parties at appropriate times.

      - A vulnerability is a potentially exploitable weakness ("loophole") of an asset.
      - A threat is a set of circumstances with potential to exploit a vulnerability and create harm to assets.
    - This is followed by the design of suitable controls (countermeasures) in order to mitigate attacks.
      - An attack is the implementation of a threat.
      - A control is an action, procedure, device or a technique used for protection.
    - It is important to note however that it is impossible to guarantee absolute security -- we can only hope to reduce risk.

  - Controls -- Types @NIST2010
    - Depends on the organisation's enterprise architecture and information security architecture
      - System-specified controls -- controls that provides security capability for a particular information system only
      - Common controls -- controls that provides security capability for multiple information system
      - Hybrid controls -- combination of both previous types
