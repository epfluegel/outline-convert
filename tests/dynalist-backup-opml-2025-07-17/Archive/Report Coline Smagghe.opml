        <outline text="1. Introduction">
            <outline text="Within the scope of my second year at ENSICAEN, I went to London in order to undertake a 16-week internship, from the 30th of May to the 17th of August, in laboratory of computer science. The aim of this internship was to conduct research on Game Theory and how it applies to Cyber Security. In this report, I will describe the work that I have carried out during this internship at Kingston University."/>
            <outline text="This report will explain what were the objectives of my project, what I have accomplished for the project and  the results that I obtained. In a first part, I will explain some generalities on Game Theory, then in a second part I will display different security games and finally I will present a game we created linked with another project on Smart Grids."/>
            <outline text="1.1 Presentation Kingston University">
                <outline text="Kingston University (KU) is consist of by three faculties, I was based in the Faculty of Science, Engineering and Computing (SEC), formed in 2011, which is comprised of three schools. The school I attended was the School of Computer Science and Mathematics and  has it-self three departments: the Department of Networks and Digital Media (which my supervisor belongs to), the Department of Computer Science and the Department of Mathematics."/>

            <outline text="1.2 The Project">
                <outline text="Game theory is a branch of mathematics originally invented in order to analyse real games mathematically. Usually, it is used for scenarios where people are playing against each other and making decisions at the same time. In the recent literature, game theory has been successfully applied to cyber security in order to model attacker/defender scenarios [1-2]. Cyber security is to do all the need in order to assure the security of the cyberspace by using: the assessment, responding and monitoring [3]. "/>
                <outline text="The aim of this project is to design, implement and test novel non-cooperative game theoretical models based on linear algebra techniques and applying them to a range of cyber security related scenarios. This project is the continuation of previous work carried out by members of the research group at Kingston [1 - 2 - 3]. "/>
            </outline>
            <outline text="1.3 Objectives">
                <outline text="The first objective of this project was to model a game to design its possible outcomes and find the corresponding payoffs. The project was actually divided into two distinct parts."/>
                <outline text="For the first part, the aim was create a taxonomy of (small) security games [4], this taxonomy would review the notations of small security games in order to adapt them to our scenarios."/>
                <outline text="And then, in a second part, we wanted to design a 2x3 actions complete information security game based on a experimental model of a smart energy system [5] and to solve the it."/>
            </outline>
            <outline text="1.4 Method of work">
                <outline text="During the first phase of the project, I read some papers from the literature about Game Theory and Security Games to get familiar with the concepts."/>
                <outline text="Then I started working on the taxonomy, I had frequent meetings with my supervisor to talk about the progress on the different games. We used the software Dynalist to share all the things we wrote on the project, this software enable the notations in LateX so I had to learn how to use it. Any progress was written as we went along so in this way we were already aware of what had been done and we could focus on the next phase of the project."/>
                <outline text="Every week or every two weeks, the Game Theory Reading Group meet to talk about all the projects that are linked to Game Theory. During those meeting we were presenting our progress about the game we design about the smart energy system [5]. Then everyone gave his opinion and advice to help us solving the potential problems we encountered."/>

        <outline text="2. Game Theory Fundamentales">
            <outline text="In this section, we will define some terms and concept of Game Theory that are relevant to the project such as what type of games we are focusing on, their representations, their outcomes and the analysis we can make of these games."/>
            <outline text="2.1 Game Characteristics ">
                <outline text="During this internship, I was only focus on two-player games that are non-cooperative and complete information games. "/>
                <outline text="A non-cooperative game is a game where players are against each other, none of them will try to help the others. In our case we have only two players so in our scenario one of them will be the Attacker $$\mathcal{A}$$ and the other the Defender $$\mathcal{D}$$ . In a complete information game, both of the players know all the strategy of their opponent. "/>
                <outline text="Depending on the game, we will have to deal with zero or non-zero sum Game. In a zero sum game, the gain of a player is the loss of the other so there is always a winner and a loser. Whereas in a non-zero sum game, the final payoff of a player correspond to the sum of his gains and his losses so each player will try to maximise his own payoff [6]."/>
            </outline>
            <outline text="2.2 Game Analysis">
                <outline text="One of the way to represent a game is to desing his utility matrix. A utility matrix is a table that describe the stategies of the players and the corresponding payoffs. Figure 1 is representing a general example of a utility matrix, here it is a 2x2 game which means that both of the players can play two different strategies: $$s^\mathcal{A}_1$$ and $$s^\mathcal{A}_2$$ for the Attacker and $$s^\mathcal{D}_1$$ and $$s^\mathcal{D}_2$$ for the Defender. For example, if the Defender choose to play $$s^\mathcal{D}_2$$ and the Attacker $$s^\mathcal{A}_1$$ then the payoffs for $$\mathcal{D}$$ will be $$c_1$$ and $$c_2$$ for $$\mathcal{A}$$. In order to solve the game, we define the two matrices A and B (figure 2) representing  the matrix of the payoffs of respectively  the Defender and the Attacker. For our taxonomy, we will focus on 2x2 games and we will see an example of a 2x3 game in Section 4. "/>
                <outline text="$$\begin{array}{ | c | c | c | }  \mathcal{D} \downarrow \mathcal{A}\rightarrow &amp; s_a &amp; s_{-{a}} \\ s_d &amp;  a_1, a_2 &amp;  b_1,  b_2 \\ s_{-d} &amp; c_1 ,  c_2 &amp;  d_1,  d_2 \end{array}$$ "/>
                <outline text="$$A= \begin{pmatrix} a_1  &amp; b_1 \\ c_1 &amp; d_1  \end{pmatrix}$$$$B= \begin{pmatrix} a_2  &amp; b_2 \\ c_2 &amp; d_2  \end{pmatrix}$$"/>
                <outline text="In Game Theory, solving a game mean  to find an equilibrium state that satisfies all the Players. For non-cooperative, we defined the Nash Equilibrium (NE) in [6] as : &quot;a steady-state condition of a game consisting in an optimal strategy where no player can improve their utility through a unilateral change of strategy&quot;. It exist two types of NE strategies : pure or mixted. A NE strategy is pure when the optimal strategy for the player is to always play the same strategy. The mixed strategy consists in choosing one of his actions with a certain probability. "/>
                <outline text="We will use the notation $$x^*$$ to define the NE optimal strategy for the Defender and $$y^*$$ for the Attacker. In the case of 2x2 non-cooperative games, as demonstrate in [6], we know that the values of $$x^*$$ and $$y^*$$ will always follow the same pathens: $$x^* = \frac{d_2 - c_2}{(d_2-c_2) +(a_2 - b_2)}  $$ and $$y^* = \frac{d_1 - b_1}{(d_1 - b_1)+(a_1-c_1)}$$. We will use these formulas in section 3 to analyze the games of our taxonomy."/>
                <outline text="From $$x^*$$ and $$y^*$$, we compute the expected payoffs for the Defender and the Attacker, that we will note $$s^*_\mathcal{D}$$ and $$s^*_\mathcal{A}$$, by doing the matrix products :  $$s^*_\mathcal{D}=x^*Ay^*$$ and $$s^*_\mathcal{A}=x^*By^*$$. I managed to compute a generic form for $$s^*_\mathcal{D}$$ and $$s^*_\mathcal{A}$$ , the results are on Annex 2, but when the utility matrix does not many different notations it is easier to recalculate with the matrix products. "/>
                <outline text="We have now completed all the step to analyze your games so we will now the taxonomy of small games that we created."/>

                <outline text="In the section we will focus on single-target games, which means that the attacker can only play two different strategies : attack or not attack, so the set of the attacker's strategies will be $$S_\mathcal{A} = \{s_a, s_{-a}\}$$ for the entire section. "/>
                <outline text="3.1.1 Attack-Defense Game    ">
                    <outline text="With the Attack-Defense Game, the aim was to create the most simple scenario as the first game of the taxonomy and as a reference for the other games. We assume here that what the defender will spend for his defense covers the entire protection of its assets and that his stategies will be defend or not defend $$S_\mathcal{D} = \{s_d, s_{-d}\}$$. "/>
                    <outline text="We introduce the following notations for the game : the defense cost  $$c^\mathcal{D}$$, the defender's loss from an attack $$l^\mathcal{D}$$, the cost of the attack $$c^\mathcal{A}$$ and the benefit of the attacker $$l^\mathcal{D}$$. We assume that the loss for the defender is what the attacker will benefit from the attack that is why we use the same notations, this process will be use for the other games of the taxonomy. "/>
                    <outline text="Because we assume that the defender will spend an adequate protection of his assets, we know that $$c^{\mathcal{D}} &lt;l^{\mathcal{D}}$$. Similarly, the attacker will not spend more than he will earn from the attack so $$c^{\mathcal{A}} &lt; l^{\mathcal{D}}$$. We define the utility matrix of this game on figure 2. "/>

                    <outline text="When I took the project,the creation of the utility matrix and the Equilibirum Analysis of the game was already done but I  redo all the computations to adapt myself to all the concepts. For this game, there is one optimal Mixed NE Strategy : $$x^{*} = \frac{l^{\mathcal{D}}-c^{\mathcal{A}}}{l^{\mathcal{D}}} = 1 - \frac{c^{\mathcal{A}}}{l^{\mathcal{D}}}$$ and $$y^{*} = \frac{c^{\mathcal{D}}}{l^{\mathcal{D}}}$$. The corresponding optimal expected utilities are: $$s^{*}_\mathcal{D} = -c^{\mathcal{D}} $$and $$s^{*}_\mathcal{A}=  0 $$. "/>
                    <outline text="This game is a non-zero sum game but  it did not have many notations so we intended to try to prove that the game is strategically equivalent to a zero sum game [7-8]. To prove that, we applied affine transformations on The A and B matrices of the game and then we use the software Gambit, wich compute the NE with numerical examples, to see if the results were similar. According the paper [7], the game should be a strategically equivalent to a zero sum, but our results was not enough conclusive to prove it. So we decided to leave that part of the project to on other games."/>

                    <outline text="With a view to doing a more realistic scenario, we created the Security-Level game where the defender is now defending with two different strengh: $$\sigma_1$$ and $$\sigma_2$$. The strategies for the Attacker do not change but the value of  his gain will now depend either if the defender use the $$\sigma_1$$-strengh defense ($$s^\mathcal{D}_{\sigma_1}$$) or use the $$\sigma_2$$-strengh defense ($$s^\mathcal{D}_{\sigma_2}$$). On the same, we now define two different defense costs : $$ c_1^{\mathcal{D}} $$ and  $$c_2^{\mathcal{D}}$$."/>
                    <outline text="For this game, I designed the utility matrix (Fig ?) with my supervisor, and then I made the Equilibrium analysis of the game thanks to the formulas define on Section 2(?). We find one optimal mixed Nash Equilibrum Strategy. For the Defender,the result is $$x^{*} = \frac{c^\mathcal{A} - (1 - \sigma_2 )l^\mathcal{D}}{(\sigma_2 - \sigma_1)l^\mathcal{D}} $$ and the correspoind payoffs is $$s^{*}_\mathcal{D} = \frac{c^\mathcal{D}_1 (\sigma_1 \sigma_2 +\sigma_2 - \sigma_1 - {\sigma_2}^2) + c^\mathcal{D}_1 (\sigma_1 \sigma_2 + \sigma_1 - \sigma_2 - {\sigma_1}^2)}{(\sigma_1-\sigma_2)^2} $$. And for the Attacker, we find $$y^{*} = \frac{c^\mathcal{D}_1 - c^\mathcal{D}_2}{(\sigma_1 - \sigma_2)l^\mathcal{D}}$$ and the optimal expected utility is $$s^{*}_\mathcal{A} = 0 $$.  "/>

                    <outline text="For this game, we are motived by the two previous games, in those two games to expected payoff of the Attacker was 0  ($$s^{*}_\mathcal{A}=  0$$) which seems not really realistic. Indeed, the Attacker will never decide to attack if he does not win anything. So we decided to add a reward $$r$$  for the attacker, wether he decides to attack or not, because he pushes the defender to spend a cost to proctect his assets. Our game is based on the Attack-Defense game (Section ??), so the set of strategy for the defender is the same $$S_\mathcal{D} =\{s^\mathcal{D}_d, s^\mathcal{D}_{-d}\}$$ and also the assumption define on Section ??.  I design the utility matrix which is represented on Figure ??. "/>

But the adding of the reward has a big impact on the payoffs because the expected utility for the Attacker is  $$s^{*}_\mathcal{A} =  \frac {{l^\mathcal{D}}^2 r - l^\mathcal{D} r c^\mathcal{A}} {{l^\mathcal{D}}^2 } = r - \frac {r c^\mathcal{A}}{l^\mathcal{D}}$$.

                <outline text="To create the Game, we introduce notations for the payoffs for the Utility Company (Figure 10)  and for the Attacker (Figure 11). The security game we are considering between the Attacker ![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/2_TPDaRjjCZCG4YnxBFf_oFQg0aZCZiE6OkBNnLHcmFgUNJybXy5Pr9AcWfxzg_jzGjTa0n_uO7otws9VaoBFSiFBY-y67NEy8sRycRWT5JMtp8nuc1DXtfKGHvd5ZwY36Os2w-E) and the Utility Company  ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ubzhhd0-yQAtCxO2aLO4MTlnAVeYlKp87JMzKYMTqet5g1bTF7qY9LyqJuvOesfC9M7Knaq4ksSdiSRc3e-VGnWFSS7IKW7ypogQcp1SAakH4vWm-Ho75EdE8cg4z8pVphrIInyk) is a non-zero sum complete information game as defined in Section 2.1. According to [10], the Utility Company has at least three possible monitoring strategies: to monitor the daily average of forecasting data, to inspect the daily shape of the aggregated forecast and to inspect the individual forecast data with the same level of detail. The Attacker, for her part, has three different strategies: she can decide to make a detectable attack, to make an undetectable attack or not to attack. We consider here that an detectable attack is a big attack so it can be detected and an undetectable a smaller one. Regarding of this information about the game, we consider the set of strategies for the players are : ![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/egAtI9o4pKkiHVu52Y_bOFxpRhTwvoeBdjtjhuPa1bmfgtlAw4VS5pJwaRVE-rs5ZSixavTWzyIbN3n-WMU9tT9PnWFF9qhYd-vFAH6pgbaD4spn83J-LuBKumZ0XLC_3iIUrwnM)and ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/aTmO03or2wcc_XqwGhiiW2S1FQR1GqDG62PbmYZNe7VPRFAVn9QZHYzcR6Mr0Yirk12g06wxcORvz9cUlRKNjERfsiTGGuuHz6WXk3Dc_JTzABqRQsz0SyibfBDw2k8rgoqaRHO5).

                <outline text="In order to solve the game and to have a more realistic vision of the results, we set two different categories of assumptions : the one that are motivated by typical security games and the ones guided by the experimentations on the commun project [10]."/>
                <outline text="In a typical security game, the defender (UC in our case) will try to spend at the most what she loses.

This project was related to the project of Ketil Grammont concerning the Smart Grid and the attacks made on this system. Thus, during a meeting with the reading group, it was decided to write an academic article on both projects. This task is really demanding and probably the most difficult I had to meet during my internship. Indeed, after working during weeks on the same project, it is difficult to get some distance with our work in order to produce something that could be easily understandable by a exterior person but in the same time to stay specific. But we did regular meetings with the rest of the group to make sure we were all coordinated and agreed on what we wanted to produce and personally, I met daily with my supervisor to talk about the content of the paragraph I was writing."/>

On Appendix 3, you can find the utility matrix that we built. But we took the decision not to keep that game because it had too many new notations and that made the utility matrix way more complicated. So we came back to the solving of our first game. Maybe it will be interesting to solve that new game in the future. "/>

            <outline text="Finally, I worked on a 2x3 game that was linked with a project from another resaerch group which was about the Smart Grid system. This game is destine to a Utility Company that would want to protect his assets according to different types of attacks.
