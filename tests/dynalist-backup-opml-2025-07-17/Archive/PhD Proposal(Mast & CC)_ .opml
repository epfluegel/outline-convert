                <outline text="Background #h2 ">
                    <outline text="In today society, technology becomes increasingly intertwined with every aspect of our life. The advancements of the Internet of things, information transfer and communication underpin the adaption of the modern technology, which as result increasingly expose our society to a significant security threats (Schneier, 2000) . "/>
                    <outline text="The implications of this growth effect the fabric of our daily life and especially with small to medium size corporates."/>
                    <outline text="Ciaran Martin, Chief executice officer of NCSC quoted in the Cyber Security: Small Business Guide 2017, stated, &quot;If you are small or medium-sized entrprise (SME) then there's around a 1 in 2 chance that you'll experience a cyber security breach.&quot;"/>
                    <outline text="A report by FirEye (year?) indicates that 77% of cyber threats are targeted small and medium size companies but only 58% of them consider this as a risk to their business. There are many examples of cyber attacks on small or large coporates which shows that even high sophisticated cyber security efforts will not address all todays and future cyber attacks. Particularly, when the intrusion effort and type of attacks are continuously evolving. "/>
                    <outline text="A particular area of concern is limitation of current security system as the traditional security approaches (static and signature based) does not mach the complexity of todays threats (dynamic threats) (Mastrogiacomo, 2017). In addition the vast amount of data and real time cyber threat information is collected from variety security solutions or from the systems that compromised or have been used by attacker. These information provide evidence based knowledge that can be use to assist decisions regarding the cyber security threats (W.Tounsi &amp; H Rais, 2018). Many organisations invest in cyber threat intelligence (CTI) services and solutions as part of their cyber security defence strategy, in an effort to enhance the protection their assets. These organisations collect and share real-time cyber threat and transform these information to threat intelligence that can be use to protect their assets or predict timely attacks. "/>
                    <outline text="However, consumption of CTI has associated challenges that are not insignificant. For example, intelligence may be disparate and fragmented. Additionally, the relevance, quality and format of such intelligence may vary dramatically; resulting in CTI that is ultimately costly and inefficiently utilised. "/>
                    <outline text="Previous study (Ponemon, February 2019) has indicated inconsistent level of processing /analysing threat intelligence data and an effictiveness gap difference in detecting cyber threat. According to this report, 85% of companies in North America and United Kingdom agree with importance of the threat intelligence but only 41% of participants believing in the effectiveness of their threat intelligence. "/>
                    <outline text="Problems with CTI: quality of information, massive amount of data which overwhelmed cyber threat analyst and finally shortage of human expert to maintain, manage and operationalise TI. This can be remedy by self explanatory platforms and ease of usebilities. UX?"/>
                    <outline text="Traditional cyber solutions are signature based and are not able to predict or detect the board range of modern type of attacks, e.g. zero-day attacks (W.Tounsi &amp; H Rais, 2018). The explosion of sophisticated cyber attacks provides a large amount of threat indicators. Analysing these indicators and real time information along with the history records provide a good ground for development of analytics models which will improve the effectivensess of CI. "/>
                    <outline text="Effect of human? and UX?"/>
                    <outline text="We propose to evaluate some of threat intelligence tools and analyse huge amount of information and data from a collection of sources and carried out an investigation in behaviour of data in order to recognise patterns and discover knowledge in data. Use of machine learning models i.e. unsupervised models such as k means clustering and supervised models suchas multi-level linear regression will produce results.  These information will be used to design and develop a robust model which will be employed to help users to identify a potential threat whilst maintain a user experience. This improved understanding of CTI should assist the development of data-driven decision-making algorithm in order to protect different type of companies."/>
                    <outline text="Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is disseminated and consumed on a global scale. Many organisations invest in CTI services and solutions as part of their cyber security defence strategy, in an effort to enhance the protection their assets. However, consumption of CTI has associated challenges that are not insignificant. For example, intelligence may be disparate and fragmented. Additionally, the relevance, quality and format of such intelligence may vary dramatically; resulting in CTI that is ultimately costly and inefficiently utilised. This research is concerned with how such challenges can be mitigated through the use of analytical algorithms, visualisation techniques and UX; in a manner that can augment, inform and ultimately enhance an organisation’s utility and efficient use of CTI." colorLabel="2"/>

            <outline text="Reference for the five phases of intelligence production:">
                <outline text="https://www.recordedfuture.com/cybersecurity-intelligence-cycle/"/>
            </outline>
            <outline text=""/>
            <outline text="1) Planning and direction">
                <outline text="The planning and direction phase of the intelligence cycle is foundational — the leaders of any organization undertaking an intelligence operation must set goals and boundaries that are informed by policy, determine what resources are available, develop a timeline, understand how much risk the organization is willing to accept, and so on, in order to set the tone for the whole operation. “Otherwise,” Zabierek says, “you’re just doing intelligence for intelligence’s sake — and especially in a corporate world, that costs time and money.” More than anything, leadership must understand the value of intelligence to properly define the goals of an intelligence operation. That means the intelligence operatives who will actually carry out the work should have a seat at the table — in a corporate setting, that might mean easy access to the leaders of an organization — but to deserve this, they must be able to justify the value of their work."/>
                <outline text="That’s not always easy. In both Peeler’s and Zabierek’s experiences, many corporate leaders struggle to fully understand the value of intelligence. Part of that is a failure on the part of analysts to communicate effectively. One of the best ways to make the case for producing intelligence, Peeler says, is to “just have conversations” with members of senior management — direct conversations that aren’t filled with jargon like, “What are your critical information requirements?” Talk that way, and you’ll get a “deer-in-the-headlight kind of look,” he says. Instead, make broader points like, “What keeps you up at night?” Even broad questions like these will give clarity and unity of vision."/>
            </outline>
            <outline text="2) Data collection">
                <outline text="The next phase in the intelligence lifecycle is the collection of data. Data, of course, is the precursor to any intelligence analysis — the raw material from which all further developments are derived. But data itself is not intelligence. In past eras of intelligence gathering, targets and sources of data were generally already known, and a cycle of intelligence production was carefully planned around them. For example, intelligence operatives in the field might identify a specific individual or group that they wanted to surveill, and all of the data collected in a particular cycle of intelligence production was targeted toward them."/>
                <outline text="But in cybersecurity today, it’s often the case that targets are hidden among a general population — markers of a threat lie buried within a vast plain of raw data. That makes the collection of data today much more of a knowledge management issue."/>
            </outline>
            <outline text="3) Processing and exploitation">
                <outline text="For that reason, the next phase, where the data is processed and exploited, has taken on even greater importance today. In short, processing and exploiting data means turning the raw information into something that an analyst can understand, identify patterns and draw conclusions from, and ultimately, take action."/>
                <outline text="But because of the much greater amounts of data that intelligence operations deal with today, Zabierek argues that the traditional wisdom of past intelligence operations no longer applies. “You don’t have to exploit the data simply because it was collected,” she says. “Because we have so much data now, we’ll never have enough people to exploit every single thing.” Often, analysts are burdened with meeting production quotas — intelligence for intelligence’s sake. Zabierek advocates for letting analysts “go down rabbit holes,” making connections and discoveries that might pay off in the future instead of worrying about weekly reports that might not have much to say."/>
                <outline text="Peeler agrees, saying that good intelligence needs to be “usable,” not actionable. The common wisdom is that all intelligence needs to drive some actionable goal, but it is vitally important to first build up a knowledge base that gives analysts a bigger picture to work with."/>
                <outline text="Building up an effective knowledge base means both collecting and processing vast amounts of data, which these days can only be done effectively with automated systems. Get machines involved, advises Zabierek. Translate data from feeds, vendor reports, image and text extraction, and network log files into something more workable. Make sure the process is repeatable. Because every organization has its own needs, that process might not look the same from one group to another, but each organization should follow a consistent cycle defined by its own goals. Organize that data by indexing it with consistent and clear metadata, cluster and link data together so it’s more searchable, and set up indicators and alerts that are relevant and won’t overwhelm your analysts."/>
                <outline text="Proper organization at this stage helps drive the “big-picture” thinking that Peeler and Zabierek emphasized throughout the talk. Good indexing makes data easy to sort and understand no matter when or where it came from. Trends become easier to identify over time, and analysts grow in their capacity to make informed predictions."/>
            </outline>
            <outline text="4) Analysis and production">
                <outline text="In support of his point that much of the hard work of intelligence production today has to do with effective knowledge management, Peeler discussed the knowledge spiral model, a theory originally proposed by Japanese business experts Ikujiro Nonaka and Hirotaka Takeuchi."/>
                <outline text="Tacit knowledge, he explains, is “intangible, internal, experiential, and intuitive knowledge,” the sort of information that might be shared through storytelling rather than codified into more explicit forms, like the language of mathematics. Explicit knowledge, by contrast, is the sort contained in manuals and procedures and passed along through formal language and structures."/>
                <outline text="Forms of tacit knowledge — the kind of intuitions that a veteran security analyst may have that gives them the ability to quickly identify patterns and make predictions, for example — begin to be codified into explicit knowledge through the development of models and mental frameworks. In this transition stage, analysts begin to generate hypotheses that will guide their data collection and organization."/>
                <outline text="In the next stage — explicit to explicit — data and knowledge is combined into a form that can be processed by humans and computers. This is the stage of indexing and structuring data."/>
                <outline text="Finally, the knowledge becomes internalized, moving from explicit to tacit. It becomes usable, driving both predictions and the planning and direction of future intelligence operations. According to Peeler, this model illustrates how intelligence is “a continuous cycle of developing insights and knowledge and understanding.” The emphasis is on process, not product: “You’re not driving to the product, you’re driving to the understanding,” he says. “The product is there to help others understand what you’re beginning to know.”"/>
            </outline>
            <outline text="5) Dissemination and evaluation">
                <outline text="The final stage of the intelligence cycle, that of dissemination and evaluation, then drives further refinements of the cycle. It’s at this stage that tacit knowledge and experience are the most valuable, and these are qualities that are the strengths of human analysts far more than computers. It’s often difficult to evaluate intelligence on its “face” validity. Zabierek advises analysts to look behind the surface evaluation and ask questions about the techniques used in analysis, the sources, and the underlying goals that drove the development of any particular set of intelligence."/>
