                <outline text="Typically, when maintaining software assets, system administrators will over time encounter the need for vulnerability management. Due to the accumulation of available patches for a potentially large number of assets, they need effective strategies for identifying those patches that are critical. A common practice that is adopted in real system scenarios is based on vulnerability scoring which provides effective means of ranking vulnerabilities by their severity. A common approach for vulnerability scoring is based on a numerical score (or metric) function $$\mu:v \rightarrow {S}$$ that is computed for the individual vulnerability, where $$\mathcal{S}$$denotes the set of valid scores."/>

                        <outline text="One way of conducting likelihood assessments is to assume that the interaction between potential cyber attackers and system administrators (who act as defenders) can be modelled as a non-cooperative game, where both players act rationally, seeking to optimise their expected payoffs.

                <outline text="__Mobile Dealer__ -- in this architecture, the sensitive information (the secret) is on the mobile device at the time when the shares are created. Typical examples are mobile users who wish to protect their application data, present on their device. "/>
