A great number of different frameworks have been suggested in the literature, and in this project you will give an overview and critical analysis and comparison of the individual methodologies. An additional contribution would be the application of a particular method to a real (or fictitious) scenario."/>

                        <outline text="Overview">
                            <outline text="Computer, network and cyber security are increasingly attracting attention by the popular media, mirroring their growing importance for everyday computer use by both individuals and organisations. Whilst cyber security can be defined as the assessment of, responding to and monitoring of the security of the cyberspace, it is difficult to pin down to one single scientific discipline, but rather relates to a number of domains and fields such as physical security, network security, security assessment frameworks and the human element."/>
                            <outline text="It is commonly agreed in the literature that sound security technology can only be designed, implemented and used if a healthy security culture is present throughout these different stages. In particular, cyber-awareness of individual users will determine their behaviour and create typical vulnerabilities such as following links sent via email and other channels, e.g. Skype and whatsapp, opening PDFs or  installing software such as executables and browser toolbars that may create software vulnerabilities. Consequently, individuals will be exposed to a great range of cyber security threats, for example 'long cons' as intensive and sustained attempt to achieve a substantial exploit, or 'short cons' such as getting children to click on a link that charges their parents' phone."/>
                            <outline text="Hence, an important security control this the ensuring of security responsible behaviour through behavioural change frameworks, which are the focus of this dissertation project."/>

                            <outline text="The overarching aim of the project is to find mechanisms, frameworks, tools and applications (in particular, &quot;gamification&quot; using mobile apps) to induce behavioural change towards increased cyber-awareness and more cyber-wise computer use in people. This could be generic users, or perhaps a specific type of user group such as older adults, or employees in an organisation."/>
                            <outline text="The following objectives are proposed:"/>
                            <outline text="  - To thoroughly review the literature of proposed behavioural change methods in the context of cyber-awareness. This review will include disciplines such as psychology, behavioural science and HCI."/>

                        <outline text="The aims of the project are to first of all investigate mechanisms, frameworks, tools and applications (in particular, &quot;gamification&quot; using mobile apps would be interesting) to induce behavioural change towards increased cyber awareness/more cyber-wise computer use in people (could be generic users, or perhaps a specific type of user groups such as older adults, or else employees in an organisation). Secondly, you could investigate the design and implementation of a prototype mechanism for carrying out such a change, and potentially (thirdly) evaluate your solution."/>

                        <outline text="For this project, a comprehensive review of the area of cloud security will be given. This will include traditional and novel threats, vulnerabilities and controls. Also, suitable threat modelling techniques could be investigated. In order to achieve a very good mark, a simulation or implementation of a basic private cloud will be carried out."/>
