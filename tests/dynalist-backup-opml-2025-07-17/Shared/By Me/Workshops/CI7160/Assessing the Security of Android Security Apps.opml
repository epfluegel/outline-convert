        <outline text="Problem Description.">
            <outline text="Scenario.">
                <outline text="Alice is using an Android Galaxy S2 Tablet for personal use. She is concerned about her media files (photos and videos) stored on the device being exposed to a third party in case of losing her tablet. She decides to install a suitable security app in order to protect her files. The purpose of this app would be to encrypt and hide her local files on her device, in particular, images and videos. #level1 #level2 "/>
                <outline text="You are a security consultant, and Alice asks you to assess the security of the 'Vault Hide Picture and Video' app that she found and intends to use. You proceed by installing the app, experimenting with some sample picture files and comparing the original and protected data. This will give you some clues about the strength of the employed encryption. What is your advice -- should Alice trust this app? Write a 100-word paragraph, justifying your recommendation. #level1 #level2 "/>
            </outline>
            <outline text="Solution.">
                <outline text="**Install mobile app.** Find, download and install the 'Vault Hide Picture and Video' app (by NewSoftwares.net) on the Samsung tablet that you were given. #level1 ">
                    <outline text="There are two ways of downloading mobile apps on Android: if you have a Google account, you can sign in on the tablet, and find apps on the Playstore. Otherwise, you can download the packaged application in the form of an .apk file from e.g. the [apkpure.com](apkpure.com) website. This method is called __sideloading__. You should save the package in the Downloads folder on your tablet. #level2 ">
                        <outline text="Alternative: the download step has been done for you and the required package is available on Canvas here: [Vault Hide Picture Video_v1.1.6_apkpure.com.apk](https://kingston.box.com/s/wqia0tibsi1q5nxv7e8zyqwlnf0f2n3m). #solution"/>
                    </outline>
                    <outline text="You can install the mobile app by tapping on it, if you have previously downloaded it using the Playstore. If you have downloaded the .apk application package from a third-party website, you first need to disable a security mechanism to prevent accidentally installing malicious apps. This can be done in the Settings, menu option `Lock screen and security`, followed by `Unknown Sources`, by allowing the installation of apps from other sources. #level2 "/>
                </outline>
                <outline text="**Use security app. **Decide on a picture file that you wish to protect using the security app. The file needs to exist on the tablet, it should be placed in the `My Files/Pictures` folder. Apply protection to your file by using opening the security app and importing the picture. Verify that the protected file is not available anymore at its previous location on the device. #level1 ">
                    <outline text="You could either create this file yourself, or download a suitable picture from the Internet (use Google Chrome). #level2 ">
                        <outline text="Alternatively, you may use the provided picture file [mce-stars.jpg](https://kingston.box.com/s/0ahgpxsoxekqc4g50xru7abfnvpz8hq0). You might have to transfer the file to your device first though, see next step. #solution"/>

                </outline>
                <outline text="**Examine protected data.** In order to further investigate security, you need to find the encrypted hidden file and copy it to your desktop computer. #level1 ">
                    <outline text="Find the encrypted picture by browsing your tablet data, directly on the device, starting in the Internal Storage. Note that its filename might be slightly altered as well. #level2 ">
                        <outline text="Watch out for the folder 'FolderLock Advanced Encrypted Data' and 'FolderLockAdvancedFree' therein, then 'Photos', and then 'Pictures' or similar depending on the name you gave when you used the app. You will eventually find the encrypted picture with a different name such as 'mce-stars#jpg', masking the filetype. #solution "/>
                    </outline>
                    <outline text="Download both the original and encrypted file to your computer. #level2 ">
                        <outline text="Step 1: Enable debugging on device. #level3 ">
                            <outline text="The following website helps you to do this: https://www.samsung.com/uk/support/mobile-devices/how-do-i-turn-on-the-developer-options-menu-on-my-samsung-galaxy-device/. #level3">
<outline text="The precise instructions on how to do this on your tablet are as follows: go to Settings, followed by About Tablet, then Software Information, and locate the Build Number options. Tap (Click) this option precisely 7 times. A message window will confirm that debugging is enabled. #level4 "/>

                            <outline text="This can be achieved through the Developer Options menu, which should now be available in the settings (provided you have managed to enable debugging the device in the previous step). #level3 ">
<outline text="From the Developer Options menu, find Enable USB Debugging and activate the switch. #level4 "/>
