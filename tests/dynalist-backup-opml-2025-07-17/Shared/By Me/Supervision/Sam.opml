                <outline text="The Blockchain is a cutting-edge technique of looping together current technologies in the fields of Big Data, Cloud Computing, and Cryptography to provide a decentralized trust-less Network. It creates an ecosystem of services that is designed effectively as a gigantic peer-to-peer network which operates on the mechanisms of the IP protocol that links the internet together. Identity verification, electronic voting, IoT (Internet of Things), creating smart contracts and Distributed Cloud Storage Systems amongst a great many other applications can now be made more secure and trustworthy as such systems are being developed on the infrastructure of the blockchain technology as at the time of this writing. In a typical and popular use case, in which independent financial institutions want to share sensitive data securely and anonymously, a conventional private blockchain will not suffice as participating nodes are typically identifiable. In this paper, with Online Social Networks (OSN) as a use case, we explore a solution we propose using Virtual Private Blockchains to enhance anonymity of users, prevent data mining and intensify the security of OSNs. The solution we propose is based on an application/platform that is created compatibility with OSNs. With the OSN provider’s authentication rights granted, the application signs up and logs in users through their service. Log in credentials are not, however, stored with the application servers or the OSN but are stored as entries on the a Private Blockchain Ledger on the user’s device. This Private Blockchain then interacts with the Public Blockchain of the proposed application, enabling regular or normal activities that typically are obtainable on the OSN."/>

                    <outline text="The convenience, efficiency, security and better resource management options that e-commerce offers makes it easy for people to trust their Banks, other financial institutions and e-commerce infrastructures to co-ordinate their business transactions online and in return they are charged or taxed for this service. However, the centralized structure of traditional banking makes it susceptible to a lot of security threats including botnet, malware, DDoS and phishing attacks amongst other problems; “While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model. Completely non-reversible transactions are not entirely possible, since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions, and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for non-reversible services” @paper1"/>
                    <outline text="This gave rise to research into more efficient and secure means for electronic/digital financial assets and transactions. As early as 1982, Chaum had outlined his blueprint of an anonymous e-cash scheme in his pioneering paper @paper2. In 1998, a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange using cryptographic algorithms to secure transactions and to monitor and prevent inflation by limiting the production of currency generally called cryptocurrency today was conceived by Wei Dai. He published his idea as an anonymous distributed cash electronic system called “b-money” @paper3."/>
                    <outline text="Bitcoin’s model and software based implementation was originally proposed in a white paper released (November 2008) by an individual or entity under the pseudonym name Satoshi Nakamoto. The paper was titled – Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.  In this paper, the author proposes Bitcoin (BTC) as a digital currency that overcomes two important challenges that has plagued the cryptographic digital currencies the bitcoin hitherto; The problem of double spending that allowed the effective counterfeiting of digital currency and that of a peer-to-peer node of the global network agreeing about the ownership of every unit of the currency &amp;amp; the total number of coins any member owns at any given time."/>
                    <outline text="A Peer to Peer (P2P) network essentially describes a flat network with no single controller or server node. Each node functions in equal capacity in providing and consuming services on the behalf of users (and their bitcoin wallets), ensuring that the supply of the currency is not regulated by one authority and the deflationary property of the Bitcoin system’s monetary resource is distributed evenly by specialized nodes called miners who do not only generate the cryptocurrency but also help secure the network by the use of a system called the Blockchain."/>
                    <outline text="The Blockchain is a decentralized database that acts as a trustworthy and transparent ledger which maintains all and any transaction records conducted using bitcoins. The integrity and the chronological order of the block chain are enforced with strong cryptography implementation; the SHA256 @paper6. The Blockchain is comprised of millions of network nodes participating in the Bitcoin network. Each node in the Bitcoin network runs a portion of Blockchain which ensures that every transaction conducted using the Digital Currency is unique across the system."/>
                    <outline text="In the diagram above, Blockchain formation is illustrated. The main chain (black) consists of the longest series of blocks from the genesis block (green) to the current block where the last transaction stopped. “Orphaned” blocks (purple) may exist outside of the main chain @paper16."/>
                    <outline text="“From a technical standpoint, the ledger of a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin can be thought of as a state transition system, where there is a &quot;state&quot; consisting of the ownership status of all existing bitcoins and a &quot;state transition function&quot; that takes a state and a transaction and outputs a new state which is the result” @paper9."/>

                    <outline text="Public BlockchainsPublic blockchains are just that, public. Anyone that wants to read, write, or join a public blockchain can do so. Public chains are decentralized meaning no one body has control over the network, ensuring the data can’t be changed once validated on the blockchain. Simply meaning, anyone, anywhere, can use a public blockchain to input transactions and data as long as they are connected to the network. Some well-known examples of Public Blockchains would be Bitcoin and Ethereum, with Bitcoin being among the first Blockchain application to prove that value could be moved across the globe without third-parties like banks or remittance companies."/>
                    <outline text="Private BlockchainsBlockchains that are private or permissioned work similarly to public blockchains but with access controls that restrict those that can join the network, meaning it operates like a centralised database system of today that limits access to certain users. Private Blockchains have one or multiple entities that control the network, leading to the reliance on third-parties to transact. A well-known example would be Hyperledger.Why are different Blockchains required?"/>
                    <outline text="Necessity is the answer to that question, well for the short term anyway. Currently public and private blockchains still have a lot of challenging technical problems that need to be sorted out, with privacy and scalability being foremost. GALLACTIC’s blockchain can certainly help with scalability due to its multi-chain architecture that allows for massive scaling to rival and in most cases surpass other blockchains in the market with transactions at 300 per second on mainchain with the ability to scale up to hundreds of thousands per second when the multi-chain model is configured for speed. The concerns over privacy will continue to be an issue due to the transparent nature of blockchain but as public blockchains introduce privacy measures, the value proposition of public blockchains will become obvious and turn most to-day’s private chains obsolete. Saying that interoperability has been the missing link in conquering the obstacles faced by both private and public blockchains by empowering them to interact and exchange values across platforms seamlessly. Developers use of the GALLACTIC Blockchain technology, that allows for private and public blockchains within its ecosystem will drive the potential to combine both public and private blockchains with innovative new solutions, designed to accomplish cross-chain exchange and greater compatibility is the way forward for all parties and their concerns."/>

            <outline text="Terminology and Setting">
                <outline text="Public-Private Blockchain Hybrid ">
                    <outline text="Public Vs Private Blockchain Networks">
                        <outline text="There are generally two distinct types of blockchain networks, the Private and the Public Blockchain networks. The private blockchain is a restricted-access network, where permission has to be granted to intending participants by a threshold of nodes or all active nodes (depending on the consensus type) for transnational and administrative participation in network activities. Examples would be such as the Hyperledger, Hashgraph, Corder etc whereas the Public blockchain, on the other hand, has a more permissionless characteristic in that anyone can join the network at any time and carry out legitimate transactions as long as they possess the buying and processing power such as in the case of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin. Interestingly, however, the security of the network and data generated is not compromised in any sense as it is ensured by the robust cryptographic functions the algorithms run on. In practice, Private blockchains are the preferred choice of private enterprises and organizations that wish to enjoy the security privileges that the blockchain provides but also needs to be able to control who can read and write data to the blockchain and also to be able to identify all active nodes hence identity management tools are often an integral function that come with a private blockchain. The Public blockchain is suitable for generalized services like cryptocurrency, a decentralized payment system where read/write rights are giving to all and the real identity of nodes may not necessarily be known. An important feature that blockchains also have that may have not been critically considered is its state: Open or Closed [@paperE]. The open or closed states of a blockchain decide who can read the data generated on the blockchain. Therefore, in as much as Public and Private blockchains exists, we can also see the possibility of other variants of the blockchain in uses cases such as the private-closed blockchain __(Construction, National Defence, Law enforcement, Military, Tax Returns)__, the private-open blockchain __(Supply-chain, Government Financial records, Corporate Income Accounts)__ the public-open blockchain __(Cryptocurrencies, betting, Video games)__, and the public-closed blockchain __(Electorial processes, Voting, Whistleblower)__."/>

                <outline text="Third Party Applications on OSNs (Facebook)">
                    <outline text="To create applications in Facebook, you first must add the Facebook developer application to your profile. You also must have access to a Web server where you can store your application -- Facebook does not host third-party programs. Applications can be Web-based, desktop-based or mobile-device-based. In other words, you can create applications that take advantage of the Facebook platform but aren't incorporated into member profiles. For example, it's possible to program an application that creates a window on your desktop that is linked to your profile's news feed.Facebook says that its application programming interface (API) is based on a Representational State Transfer (REST) interface, a term coined by Roy Fielding in his Ph.D. dissertation at the University of California, Irvine. In a REST network, form follows function. Fielding's ultimate REST network was an idealized version of the World Wide Web that had independent components that worked together to maximize the efficiency of data transfers"/>
                    <outline text="In terms of Facebook's API, a REST-interface means that applications interfacing with Facebook send method calls using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) GET or POST requests. HTTP is the communications protocol used by the World Wide Web -- the GET request retrieves information and the POST request adds information to an existing Web page. This means that Facebook applications can retrieve information from member profiles, post messages to profiles or do both.Developers can also use the Facebook Query Language (FQL), which is similar to Structured Query Language (SQL). Query languages are programming languages designed to retrieve information from databases. With FQL, a developer can obtain information about any user who downloads his or her application. In a way, that's really what Facebook applications are all about -- gathering information about users. Developers could use this information as a way to create target audiences for advertising or build a consumer base for a particular product. Facebook has been criticized by people who believe the site allows application developers to gather data from members, including personal information and Web surfing habits.For those developers who want to create applications that deeply integrate themselves into Facebook's platform, there's the Facebook Markup Language (FBML). Facebook derived the language from HTML and added some site-specific tags. Using this language, developers can create applications that become a more integral part of the user's Facebook experience, affecting profile appearance and function.Every application has a space on Facebook called a canvas page, which developers can use however they wish. When a user clicks on an application icon, his or her web browser goes to that application's canvas page. Developers can include Web advertising on canvas pages, sell products using a Facebook-designed interface or simply share information with the user."/>

                <outline text="Bitcoin">
                    <outline text="The primary idea of a blockchain is to develop a decentralized system, so there needs to be a combination of the state transaction or interaction verification system with a consensus system in order to ensure that all nodes on the network agree on the order of transactions. Them Blockchain's decentralized consensus process requires nodes in the network to continuously attempt to produce packages of transactions called &quot;blocks&quot;. The network is proposed to produce a block every ten minutes, with each of the blocks containing a nonce, a timestamp, a reference to the fingerprint (which is the hash) of the previous block and a list of all of the transactions that have taken place since the previous block. "/>
                    <outline text="Over a period of time, this creates a consistent and persistent, ever-growing, &quot;blockchain&quot; that updates constantly to represent its most recent state @paper8 .The algorithm for checking for the validity of a block is expressed in this paradigm below:">
                        <outline text="Check to confirm the existence and validity of the previous block referenced by the block."/>
                        <outline text="Check to see if the timestamp of the block is greater than that of the previous block [NEW 2]and less than 2 hours into the future"/>
                        <outline text="Check to confirm the validity of the proof of work on the block."/>
                        <outline text="Let X[0] be the state at the end of the previous block."/>
                        <outline text="Assuming TQ is the block's transaction list with n transactions, it follows that for all i in 0...n-1, set X[i+1] = APPLY(X[i], TQ[i]) If any application returns an error, exit and return false."/>
                        <outline text="Return true, and register X[n] as the state at the end of this block [8]."/>
                    </outline>
                    <outline text="Effectively, each transaction in the block must present a valid state transition from what was the canonical state before the transaction was executed to a new state. It should be noted that the state is not encoded in the block in any way; it is simply an abstraction to be remembered by the validating node and can only be securely computed for any block by starting from the genesis state and consecutively applying every transaction in every block. It should also be noted that the order in which the miner includes transactions into the block is of great pertinence; if there are two transactions Y and Z in a block such that Z spends a UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) created by Y, then the block will be valid if Y comes before Z but not otherwise @paper8 ."/>
                    <outline text="The one validity condition present in the above list that is not found in other systems is the requirement for &quot;proof of work&quot;. The condition is that the fingerprint, which is a double-SHA256 hash of every block, treated as a 256-bit number, must be less than a target (Which can be dynamically adjusted), which as of the time of this writing is approximately 2187. The principal drive of this idea is to make block creation computationally difficult, which will greatly prevent Sybil attackers from redesigning the entire blockchain in their favour. SHA256 is designed to be a completely unpredictable pseudorandom function, hence, trial and error is the only way to create a valid block, repeatedly incrementing the nonce and checking if the new hash matches @paper8."/>
                    <outline text="Considering the current target of ~2187, the network must make an average of ~269 tries before a valid block is found; generally, the target is recalibrated by the network every 2016 blocks so that averagely, a new block is produced by some node in the network every ten minutes. In order to reward miners (nodes who are successful in their attempt to solve the PoW) for this computational work, the miner of every block is permitted to include a transaction giving themselves 25 BTC(Based o Bitcoin's network) out of nowhere. Furthermore, if any transaction has a higher total denomination in its inputs than in its outputs, the difference goes to the miner as well. This is called a &quot;transaction fee&quot;. Parenthetically, this is also the only mechanism by which BTC are issued; the genesis state contained no coins at all @paper8 ."/>
                    <outline text="To better understand the purpose of mining, an examination of what happens in the event of a malicious attacker would throw some light. The underlying cryptographic Techniques employed on the Blockchain is known to be secure, hence, the attacker will target the one part of the  system that is not directly protected by cryptography: the order of transactions @paper8. The attacker's strategy is supposedly simple as thus Attacker sends 10 BTC to an online commercial merchant like Amazon in exchange for some product (preferably a rapid-delivery digital good like a trending movie on Amazon prime. Attacker waits delivery of the product. Attacker produces another transaction and send the same 50 BTC to himself and  tries to convince the network that his transaction to himself was the one that came first."/>
                    <outline text="On the completion of the first step, a few minutes later some miner on the network will include the transaction in a block, say block number 320000. One hour later five more blocks will have been added to the chain after that block, with each of those blocks indirectly pointing to the transaction and thus &quot;confirming&quot; it. At this point, the merchant will accept the payment as finalized and deliver the product; since this is a digital good, delivery is instant. Now, the attacker creates another transaction sending the 10 BTC to himself. If the attacker simply releases it into the wild on the network, the transaction will not be processed; miners will attempt to run APPLY(X,TQ) and discover that TQ consumes an Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) which is no longer in the state. So instead, the attacker creates a fork (an independent development of a blockchain where the parent block is a copy of the last block of a valid blockchain) of the blockchain, starting by mining another version of block 320000 pointing to the same block 319999 as a parent but with the new transaction in place of the old one. Because the block data is different, it would require the redoing the proof of work. Additionally, the attacker's new version of block 320000 has a different hash, so the original blocks 320001 to 320005 do not &quot;point&quot; to it; thus, the original chain and the attacker's new chain are totally separate. The rule is that in a fork the longest blockchain is taken to be the truth, and so legitimate miners will work on the 320005 chain while  the attacker alone is working on the 320000 chain. In an attempt to make his chain the longest,  the attacker would need to have more computational power than the rest of the network put together in order to catch up This is called the 51% attack"/>

Hierarchical social networks decide the flow of user’s information and data feeds through an algorithm which is too centralized and not diverse enough. The software algorithms that determine what you see on social media sites prioritize revenue over veracity. It directly affects the gap between the rich and the poor in the real world and extracts an excessive amount of value from creators and users.

This idea is particularly interesting because as an active node on this Virtual Private Network existing in the Online Social Network, user profile information and user-generated data/content can be hidden from any non-intended audience (crucially, this includes the Online Social Network provider). Rather than grant broad consent to the OSN provider, countless apps and services, and have their identity data spread across numerous providers, individuals need a secure, encrypted digital hub where they can store their identity data and easily control access to it."/>
