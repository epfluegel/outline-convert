        <outline text="Project Phase"/>
        <outline text="During the Project phase, students plan and carry out their work, and initiate and maintain contact with the academic supervisor.  It is expected that students will have regular meetings with their supervisors, at least every two weeks (and ideally weekly). The student should monitor his/her progress as well as review and evaluate the work, reporting significant issues which may affect the project in a timely manner to the supervisor, . We suggest that students __at least__ create an audit trail for their project (for example, by keeping a log book for notes, a spreadsheet indicating hours dedicated to various tasks, and a folder for e-mail messages).  If milestones are not being met, then the project plan needs to be changed."/>
        <outline text="Supervisors discuss and indicate the suitability of intended deliverables, suggest starting points for consideration of background research, and discuss the nature of the dissertation and comment on drafts.  They also provide advice, where possible, on issues associated with the project such as design, implementation, proof of concept and project management."/>
        <outline text="__           __"/>
        <outline text="__Formative Viva/presentation (formative)__"/>
        <outline text="This is a formative assessment for the final viva and a formative feedback for the rest of the project and the final dissertation.  It is important to demonstrate the ability to summarise the results of your work and present them to others. You will be asked to prepare a presentation – 30 minutes Including 15 minutes questions and discussion - summarising the progress you have made and your plans to complete the project. This will be seen by your supervisor."/>
        <outline text="The Viva/Presentation comprises:">
            <outline text="Work to date.  Including">
                <outline text="Background and motivation."/>
                <outline text="Progress, for example, objectives achieved, preliminary results, specifications etc."/>

            <outline text="__Dissertation ____(Summative – 80%)__"/>
        </outline>
        <outline text="The Dissertation should be between 12,000 and 18,000 words excluding Appendices.  As the largest single piece of writing you may have ever done, you will need considerable time after you have completed the project work itself, to write your Dissertation (see Section 6)."/>
        <outline text="A typical structure for the Dissertation is as follows:"/>
        <outline text="Title Page (see format in Appendix )"/>
        <outline text="A contents page"/>
        <outline text="List of figures and/or tables"/>
        <outline text="Glossary of Terms_"/>
        <outline text="Introduction (As in Proposal, &amp; Abstract, Aims and Objectives, Summary of Thesis  ">
            <outline text="Contributions and Thesis Outline)   "/>

            <outline text="Implementation and Evaluation)   "/>

            <outline text="dissertation."/>
        </outline>
        <outline text="Bibliography: this refers to background material that is not specifically referred to in the main text of the dissertation and therefore it is unusual for a dissertation to have a significant Bibliography section, if at all."/>
        <outline text="Appendices (numbered and titled – as required)."/>
        <outline text="Note, however, that the best organisation and structure for each report is different – it reflects the nature of the topic addressed, so expect to adapt the above starting point to meet your individual needs. You can discuss the structure of your dissertation with your supervisor."/>
        <outline text="Take care to give reasons for all decisions you make – justify and explain.  The same goals could have been achieved differently – what are the advantages and disadvantages of doing it your way?"/>
        <outline text="An integral part of the report is appropriate consideration to legal, professional and ethical issues."/>
        <outline text="You are expected to include in your project report ideas, methods and results produced by other people - if you do not it probably indicates a lack of background research and is likely to be penalised.  However, __you must be scrupulously careful to cite clearly the author/originator of any such work__. If you fail to indicate the source of such material you are, by implication, claiming someone else’s work as your own. This is regarded as a serious matter in academic circles and it carries severe penalties. __(see Appendix on Academic Misconduct in the Student Handbook)__."/>

        <outline text="__Demonstration/Presentation ____(Summative – 10%)__"/>
        <outline text="Contact your supervisor and second marker, typically by e-mail, to arrange a joint appointment within 2 weeks of submission to demonstrate and/or present your project.  Demonstrations are appropriate for projects that have involved development work.  Special arrangements for demonstrations/presentation, such as demonstration at an Industrial Host, will normally have been arranged at the proposal stage.  We reserve the right to request a demonstration/presentation in person at Kingston University – it is essential to be able to assess the project fairly and accurately. "/>
        <outline text="A demonstration normally lasts around 30 minutes and proceeds typically as follows (discuss before hand with your supervisor what is expected):"/>
        <outline text="·       a summary of the project (5-10 .ppt slides);"/>
        <outline text="·       key functionality is demonstrated by the student;"/>
        <outline text="·       members of staff attempt to use the system themselves;"/>
        <outline text="·       examination of code.  Staff may, for example, ask the student to show them selected segments of the code to discuss its design, step through the code describing it line by line, or to make small changes to the functionality.  Questions may arise at any point."/>
        <outline text="Presentations normally take the form of 5-10 slides accompanying a 15min talk to the supervisor and second marker and followed by 15 min of questions."/>
        <outline text=""/>
        <outline text="For information on the marking criteria of this element can be found in the appendices section."/>
        <outline text="__Electronic Copy__"/>
        <outline text="An electronic copy of your dissertation must be submitted via the Turnitin system on Canvas. "/>
        <outline text="All dissertations/final year projects in SEC, which have achieved a grade of 60% or above, will be made available to other students via an electronic repository (KUDiss). If your dissertation/project needs to be exempt from this due to confidentiality reasons, then you will need to ask to restrict access to your dissertation (see Appendix – Electronic Storage of Dissertation)."/>
        <outline text="Learning Outcomes"/>
        <outline text="On successful completion of the module, students will be able to:">
            <outline text="Select, justify and use effectively the research methods and techniques appropriate for particular cases in order to carry out a literature search and an independent work of research"/>
            <outline text="Critically identify the need to position their research in the wider academic or business context and structure the dissertation format to agreed conventions"/>
            <outline text="Plan, manage and critically evaluate the project using the techniques and tools needed in order to bring it in successfully on time and within resourcing limits"/>
            <outline text="Identify and critically analyse real-world problems or knowledge gaps to which academic concepts and methods can be realistically applied to improve or resolve the problem situation"/>
            <outline text="Apply skills to show an ability to engage in academic and professional communication with others in their field through report and presentation"/>
            <outline text="Present critical awareness in applying appropriate legal, social or ethical obligations and when required, respond to the financial and other constraints of a corresponding business environment."/>
