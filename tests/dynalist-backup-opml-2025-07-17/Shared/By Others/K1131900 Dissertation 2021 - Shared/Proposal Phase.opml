        <outline text="Each project is supervised by an academic staff. We publish a list of academic staff who supervise MSc projects together with an indicative list of their areas of interest and possible topics for their MSc projects. You can find more about the academic, professional and research activities of these academic staff by browsing the Faculty's web pages (under “Research” and “People”). Once you have found a member of staff whose interests or projects you are interested in, you should contact them to discuss their project ideas. In most cases you will then be able to formulate a project guided by a member of staff who would then normally accept to being your supervisor. Note that it is also important that your proposed project is in the field of your MSc Course (e.g. normally an e-commerce project would not be acceptable for an embedded systems student and so will not be accepted by the student's Field Leader)."/>
        <outline text="Some students (specially those in employment) could, exceptionally, themselves identify a specific problem suitable for their MSc programme, typically for their employer. If you would like to do this it is vital that you consult with your Field Leader for approval while at the same time identify an academic staff in the field of the proposed project to ensure that what you are proposing is within scope and at the level of an MSc project."/>
        <outline text="Under the guidance of your potential supervisor you should then develop a Project Proposal to define the project's scope, consider relevant objectives, propose how access to the necessary technologies will be gained, identify required resources, estimate the risks and constraints, list expected deliverables and milestones, etc."/>
        <outline text="You should start thinking about your project as soon as the course begins, and in any case at least 6-8 weeks before the ‘Project registration form’ submission deadline"/>
        <outline text="Consider and discuss alternatives in the light of your interests, abilities and career aspirations, those of the members of staff (and industrial host if appropriate) and of the resources/opportunities available.  There is a limit to the number of projects any member of staff can take, so begin early to avoid disappointment.  Then after submitting your project registration form, you need to start building your Individual project definition  gradually develop an increasingly clear and complete statement of the project’s background, aims, literature review, methods, risks and deliverables. "/>
        <outline text="__ __"/>
        <outline text="__Project registration form (formative)__"/>
        <outline text="You need to submit the project registration form (see Appendix –project registration form).  This form includes – title of your project, overview, aims and objectives and  supervisors’ name (see Appendix). "/>
        <outline text="The Projects registration forms are then formally approved by the Field Leader who also confirms/names the supervisor and allocate the second marker. Once this is done, the project can formally start."/>
        <outline text="For information on the marking criteria of this element can be found in the appendices section of this document. "/>
        <outline text="Every student must submit a project registration form by the deadline specified. Students who do not submit a project registration form must contact their Field Leader."/>
        <outline text="__Individual project definition and research proposal (Summative – 10%)__"/>
        <outline text="The Project Proposal is between 3000 – 4000 words in length excluding Appendices.  It comprises:"/>
        <outline text="Introduction (Motivation, Background, Context &amp; Research Problem)  "/>
        <outline text="Aims and Objectives (Suitability &amp; SMARTness)  "/>
        <outline text="Initial Literature Review (Review and References)  "/>
        <outline text="Ethics Relevance &amp; Progress  "/>
        <outline text="Technologies &amp; Resources (Relevance, Alternatives)  "/>
        <outline text="Research Method &amp; Work Plan"/>
        <outline text="For information on the marking criteria of this element can be found in the appendices section of the module guidelines. "/>
        <outline text="Note that a project that uses human subjects/data requires approval by the Faculty's Research Ethics Committee. This includes projects that involve people surveys/questionnaires. Please seek advice from your Field Leader and Supervisor as you should allow enough time to apply for ethics approval."/>
        <outline text="Where relevant, proposals should clarify Intellectual Property Rights (Industrial or KU Research Hosts may wish to claim copyright, particularly if they pay the student for any work done), the arrangements for demonstrations, and approval for academic access to the code (it may be inspected to be assessed, and displayed to students and staff in the Kingston University library)."/>
        <outline text="Learning Outcomes">
            <outline text="Select, justify and use effectively the research methods and techniques appropriate for particular cases in order to carry out a literature search and an independent work of research"/>
            <outline text="Plan, manage and critically evaluate the project using the techniques and tools needed in order to bring it in successfully on time and within resourcing limits"/>

            <outline text="Present critical awareness in applying appropriate legal, social or ethical obligations and when required, respond to the financial and other constraints of a corresponding business environment"/>
            <outline text="Identify and critically analyse real-world problems or knowledge gaps to which academic concepts and methods can be realistically applied to improve or resolve the problem situation"/>
