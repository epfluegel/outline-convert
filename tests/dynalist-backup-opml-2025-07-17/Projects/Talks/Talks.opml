                        <outline text="Today I will do something very different to the last videos, I will not do life editing but simply give a lecture. I'm going to use Dynalist for this task."/>
                        <outline text="Overview: I will motivate the importance of writing a good abstract, I will then explain what an abstract actually is, and run through our couple of different definitions of abstract types. The key slide is then my methodology for creating a good abstract structure, I will then reflect on when and how it is best to write the abstract, followed by a summary and some homework for the next video!"/>

                        <outline text="Why is it important to have a good abstract?"/>

                        <outline text="It needs to be short and concise, but it also needs to be complete. And that's exactly the problem."/>
                        <outline text="You might have come across different types of abstracts, for example:"/>
                        <outline text="The executive summary is usually written by a technical person for a non-technical audience. We will not focus on this today."/>

                    <outline text="Organisations are increasingly facing cyber attacks, targeting their systems and data"/>
                    <outline text="Security assessment and risk analysis are popular techniques for informing budget spending in relation to security controls"/>
                    <outline text="They mainly focus on analysing the expected impact of an attack on the organisation's assets"/>
                    <outline text="However, this is a difficult task and tricky to get accurate estimates."/>
                    <outline text="Could there be new methodologies, focusing on &quot;the other side&quot;, i.e. the motivation that an external attack might have on launching attacks?"/>
                </outline>
                <outline text="Research Contributions #slide ">
                    <outline text="This paper presents two contributions.">
                        <outline text="The first contribution is a novel framework for risk assessment of cyber security attacks on an organisation."/>
                        <outline text="The second contribution is an application of this framework to game-theoretic risk assessment."/>
                    </outline>
                    <outline text="The main difference to previous work is:">
                        <outline text="The novel framework, entitled MAEVA, focuses on the attackers perspective (rather than the defender, i.e. the security assessor)"/>
                        <outline text="We develop a scheme, entitled the Attack Incentive Matrix (AIM), which can be contrasted with the standard Risk Response Matrix"/>
                    </outline>
                    <outline text="Benefits arise when using this framework in combination with traditional approaches, as it might increase accuracy of risk estimates"/>
                </outline>
                <outline text="The Challenges of Risk Computation #slide ">
                    <outline text="Using formal notation, the risk $$R$$ can be expressed as an expected impact $$I$$."/>
                    <outline text="This can be computed using the following equation:">
                        <outline text="$$R = p \cdot I. $$$$ #label:RiskEq"/>
                    </outline>
                    <outline text="Here $$p$$ is the probability of an attack occurring, often referred to as {\em attack likelihood}."/>
                    <outline text="From this equation, one can see that the problem now is to quantify and compute $$p$$ and $$I$$ and the difficulty is to perform a realistic estimate of these variables."/>

                <outline text="Risk Assessment Based on Risk Response Matrix #slide ">
                    <outline text="It is now assumed that one is able to determine the attack likelihood $$p$$."/>
                    <outline text="This leads to a table containing risk response actions, such as defending critical assets, recovering from an attack, planning for defense or choosing not to respond at all."/>
                    <outline text="An appropriate response action is then determined by indexing the table rows with attack probabilities using qualitative metrics (low, medium or high) and its columns with a measure for the impact (minor, moderate or major) of the attack."/>
                    <outline text="This table is referred to as {\em Risk Response Matrix} (RRM) in this talk."/>

Every year, thousands of them are compromised or receive unsolicited, misleading or illegal comments. Rather than purely relying on the account owners to spot and report these incidents, YouTube is employing dedicated staff to periodically screen randomly selected channels. Unfortunately, this screening process is time-consuming, staff need to be appropriately trained and might also need counselling. Hence, the question arises whether a strategy could be devised in order to replace the random selection process by a more informed one, taking into account the attacker's motivation.__ #eyo-style:Normal "/>

The security policy of his organisation only allows for critical patching of one software per day, due to issues with bandwidth and system downtime during the patching process. He has identified two different vulnerabilities that require patching. He downloads their CVSS scores but finds that they are very similar, making it difficult to decide on a priority ranking. He would like to use some information contained in some CVSS subscores in such a way that he follows game-theoretic principles, taking into account both the attacker's capabilities and the impact on the system. This would give him a different view and could potentially lead to a clearer prioritisation."/>

As a consequence, some employees become lazy and do not fully divulge the extend of occurring incidents.
