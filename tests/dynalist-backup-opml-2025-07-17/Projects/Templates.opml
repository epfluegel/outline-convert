                    <outline text="In this short article, just before Christmas, I wanted to wrap up my previously presented use cases for AI in professional and academic writing, and also present a first misuse case."/>
                    <outline text="Let us recall that I have used terminology from productivity (deep work) and the notion of depth ratio to show how it can characterise various use cases, based on the investment in the depths that the user has to make, the depth achieved by the AI, and the human-in-the-loop interaction required to achieve this. "/>
                    <outline text="Furthermore, I will also differentiate the desired depth achieved, in preparation of the misuse case that I would like to present."/>
                    <outline text="The following table summarises all of this."/>
                    <outline text="For now, I will focus on the first four use cases only. "/>
                    <outline text="We notice that with the exception of Use Case 3, they all have deep desired outputs. The only use case where the depth ratio is greater than one is AI As Creative Colleague. I have discussed this in my previous article and stated that the knowledge base available to the AI gives it a real advantage here."/>
                    <outline text="The other use cases with desired deep output require prompt engineering or researching facts in order to improve quality of the output and to avoid mistakes. This explains the depth ratio which is approximately one."/>
                    <outline text="Use Case 3 can be seen as a convenient way to achieve a quick shallow output, the main advantage of using AI is probably a speed up."/>
                    <outline text="I will now present order call a misuse case: this is a fairly generic ineffective or potentially unethical use of AI tools, with the aim of creating deep textual output."/>
                    <outline text="AI The Boilerplate Template Generator"/>
                    <outline text="Boilerplate text, or simply boilerplate, is any written text (copy) that can be reused in new contexts or applications without significant changes to the original. "/>
                    <outline text="In this misuse case, for various reasons (haste, ignorance, lack of time or energy), this temptation to achieve deep output (a publishable paper, a grade a assignment or a viral blog article) without significant investment."/>
                    <outline text="Using AI as a quick generating tool to produce boilerplate text seems like a quick win, but if you want to create deep output, it will backfire."/>
                    <outline text="This is because you cannot create depth using AI without significant investment."/>
                    <outline text="This is why I differentiate between desired and achieved depth"/>
                    <outline text="User might or might not be aware"/>
                    <outline text="I am pleased that I went through the trouble of writing up my use cases and publishing them to an interested audience. This has been helpful in three ways:"/>
                    <outline text="1.  It has been very useful for myself to clarify how I can use AI for my own writing, based on the various use cases."/>
                    <outline text="2.  In conversations with others, I have found that similar use cases emerge. This gives me confidence that I'm on the right track."/>
                    <outline text="3.When discussing this with my students and referring to them in class, it has been very helpful to establish these reference use cases as a pedagogical aid."/>
                    <outline text="Interestingly, I have easily found out that the book &quot;Co-Intelligence: Living and Working with AI&quot; by Ethan Mollik [1], published earlier this year, comes up with very similar categorisation of collaborating with AI. The book has , amongst others, chapters for AI as creative, co-worker, tutor and coach and puts forward the same idea that It makes sense to Treat AI like a person: Understand AI as a collaborative tool, similar to a fast but sometimes unreliable intern, colleague or boss..."/>
                    <outline text="To summarise my efforts in getting systematic when wanting to use Generative AI for speeding up, enriching or otherwise improving the process of professional and academic writing, number of use cases came to mind."/>
                    <outline text="It could also be that you start off with one use case, and end up with another. For example, initially you have little knowledge on a specific topic and start with Use Case IV. As you gain more insights, and become aware of mistakes that your mentor has made, you gain more knowledge become increasingly expert. Eventually, you will overtake the AI's knowledge and end up in Use Case II."/>
                    <outline text="The idea to measure the increase of depth based on an AI tool is perhaps tempting, but this might not be as clear cut as one might think. Generally, the work will still require deep input on your behalf, but you can use AI to speed up the process, especially at the beginning (writer's block). Additional parameters such as the time required, cognitive effort and mastering of writing skills are also involved. The final answer might be somehow the alleviating of friction and psychological burden, by either reducing them or speeding up in the process."/>
                    <outline text="For now, my last word on this would be that AI tools, in the right hands of an expert in the subject matter, are a fantastic boost of productivity for writing. But with enough practice and awareness of suitable use cases, anyone can reap their benefits."/>

                    <outline text="Here are some learning points for you to consider: #h2 " listStyle="arabic">
                        <outline text="On the whole, you have covered a lot of pertinent aspects."/>
                        <outline text="You could further improve the content and scope of your report, if you systematically distinguish between typical examples, their implications and impact, and ways to mitigate resulting harm."/>
                        <outline text="This could lead to some kind of categorisation, sometimes referred to as a taxonomy, and although this might be beyond the scope of this report, it is a useful concept to be familiar with."/>
                        <outline text="You will find examples on the web, under the topic of how to conduct a good literature review."/>
                        <outline text="I wonder whether you could focus a little bit more on social and economic impacts. I was particularly intrigued by your example of the reduced joy of driving. Could you see parallels in other areas? For example, I am thinking of the reduced joy I have personally in renting streamed music, versus the pleasure of owning physical copies of CDs. Maybe there is a general principle behind this, the &quot;loss of ownership&quot;..."/>
                        <outline text="One more tip: try to use a variety of sources within the same section, otherwise you will shape the structure of your report according to what others say. You need to lead the discussion with your own ideas and contrast it with what others have said."/>
                        <outline text="An example section, where this happens, is section 2.1."/>
                        <outline text="My main suggestion how to improve critical analysis for your report is to broaden your focus on the idea that both, the Chinese government and the protesters, are using technology to engage in a battle akin to a war. Every advance on one front will lead to a counter-attack on the other, and so on. Where will this all end? What are the different moves? How did it historically start? For example, initially, protesters had a clear advantage with the invention of mobile phone technology, as they could plan undisturbed where to meet, for example."/>
                        <outline text="And I find that the very first sentence of your introduction is slightly distracting, as it could be interpreted far more generally (so not only the impact on demonstrators)."/>
                        <outline text="On the whole, I find that you provide valuable content and a discussion of advantages and disadvantages of AI. This would have been even more apparent, if you have provided suitable section headings (as mentioned in the previous feedback category)."/>
                        <outline text="Especially in the closing part of your report, a balanced view of advantages and disadvantages (with perhaps a little bit more critical stance, I am not sure whether artificial intelligence is &quot;freeing&quot; mankind-- it is just seems to shift responsibility) would be very useful."/>
                        <outline text="A precise example how artificial intelligence impacts on your own professional or personal life would also be very interesting to read."/>
                        <outline text="You have basically covered the essential positive and negative aspects of 5G technology, but you could do this in a more systematic way. For example, its speed advantage could be mentioned in a separate subsection, early on, to draw attention to it. This seems a vital aspect!"/>
                        <outline text="In terms of drawbacks, I wonder whether one should also mention increased energy consumption and its impact on global warming these days."/>
                        <outline text="Your conclusion is very positive, you might want to state that this is your personal opinion (it is not mine, but that is okay, this will not affect your mark!)."/>
                        <outline text="In order to make your argument is even clearer, you could include a discussion of the initially suggested centralised architecture, and perhaps compare and contrast the UK situation with that of other countries."/>
                        <outline text="Are you able to draw a more general conclusion, in terms of how useful contact tracing mobile applications might be in the best possible scenario?"/>
                        <outline text="In order to provide an even deeper discussion of the impact of biometrics, you could explore the competition between security and usability. I think the main advantage of biometrics is not strong security, but ease of use. Most users are lazy! Security can get in the way. "/>
                        <outline text="Hey three what does extortion mean When you say &quot;I can safely say&quot;, you probably will need to state that you are expressing your own opinion."/>
                        <outline text="And one more food for thought: another drawback of the use of biometrics is the potential for quite nasty extortion, apparently this has happened, with people's fingers!!!"/>
                        <outline text="My main suggestion for further improvements would be a more balanced discussion, can you try to find some additional benefits from using social media? After all, you do conclude on a positive note. So why not mention advantages in education (during lockdown?), Information retrieval and so on."/>
                        <outline text="Also, you could talk more about the personal impact on you, if you want to say that of course."/>
