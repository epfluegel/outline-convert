The purpose of this paper is to present a security vulnerability analysis approach to find critical areas along railway transportation routes specifically with regard to trains carrying dangerous goods. In this study, ALOHA and ArcGIS software are used for checking the security vulnerabilities and to estimate the population and affected infrastructure due to a malicious attack. Chlorine transportation on the Texas-Illinois rail corridor (in the US) is studied by developing a routing model. The priorities of the infrastructure for the terrorist’s attack are a variety of land use types as sports, educational, commercial, and health centers; religious places; government buildings; airports; parks; and museums. In addition to the infrastructure, the size and the density of the population within the threat zone are main items for the terrorist to plan the attack. With demographic layers in the GIS software, the number of people residing in the study area that are exposed to the attack is identified. A zero-sum game theoretic approach is employed to model the interactions of terrorist and operator's strategies. After running the model, (i) the operator’s route selection probabilities are calculated, and (ii) the terrorist’s target link selection probabilities are also determined. This paper shows that how critical links can be identified for different terrorist purposes, which could be the subject of further security measures.},"/>

Game theory is suitable for solving this problem, for it provides a theoretical framework for analyzing the intelligent decisions from both attackers and defenders. However, existing methods are only based on complete information and only consider a single type of attacker, which is not always available in realistic situations. Furthermore, although infrastructure interconnection has been greatly improved, there is a lack of methods considering network characteristics. To overcome these limitations, we focus on the problem of infrastructure network protection under asymmetry information. We present a novel method to measure the performance of infrastructure from the network perspective. Moreover, we propose a false network construction method to simulate how the defender applies asymmetric information to defend against the attacker actively. Meanwhile, we consider multiple types of attackers and introduce the Bayesian Stackelberg game to build the model. Experiments in real infrastructure networks reveal that our approach can improve infrastructure protection performance. Our method gives a brand new way to approach the problem of infrastructure security defense.},"/>

Such accidents can thus be investigated from the viewpoint of system engineering. System-Theoretic Accident Model and Processes (STAMP) is a systemic method for safety assessment, which has been adopted in many domains. This approach can provide deep insights of accident causes by considering direct and indirect factors. Meanwhile, competition and cooperation between stakeholders in accidents are observed. Therefore, these parties can also be analyzed with the game theory. That is, stakeholders in STAMP can be regarded as players in game. The aim of this paper is to provide a new insight to analyze urban pipeline accidents by considering both STAMP and game theory. In this paper, we proposed an accident model for urban pipelines, with a case study of China-Qingdao pipeline accident occurred in 2013. We concluded that accident reasons can be investigated in-depth and lessons can be learned from analyzing causal factors by using STAMP. Based on results generated from STAMP, we applied the game theory to analyze roles that government and companies act in the China-Qingdao urban pipeline accident. The results show that current punishment and incentive systems are incomplete, lacking of the driving force and constraining force for the stakeholders involved in the accident.},"/>

Unlike other critical infrastructures, intentional attacks on installations in the chemical sector may escalate, resulting in a chain of major accident scenarios, which are called intentional domino effects. In light of the severe consequences of intentional domino effects, this chapter introduces the security risk assessment concerning intentional domino effects. Risk assessment of intentional domino effects consists of five main steps: threat analysis, attractiveness analysis, the vulnerability of installations exposed to attacks, the vulnerability of installations exposed to subsequent domino effects, and the overall consequences of attacks considering possible domino effects.

Since many infrastructures have network functions, it is necessary to study them from the perspective of network science. Game theory provides a suitable framework to model the confrontations in critical infrastructures. Previous models that combine network science with game theory only consider the condition of complete information. However, in the real world, complete information about the target network is not always available to the attacker. In this paper, we achieve active defense by revealing the disguised network to the attacker rather than changing the structure of the target network. We first introduce a false network generation method and investigate the transformation of the node degree in the created network. Furthermore, we propose a Stackelberg game under asymmetric information named the active deception game, in which the cost constraint is considered. Experiments based on the synthetic scale-free network indicate that disclosing false information to the attacker yields a higher equilibrium payoff than revealing complete information. We analyze the equilibrium strategies and show an interesting but counterintuitive finding that the attacker tends to choose high-degree nodes, but the defender prefers selecting low-degree nodes when the attacker does not have a global dominance strategy. Our work provides a new approach to the proactive defense of infrastructure networks using information asymmetry between attack and defense sides, which deserves further study.Modern society is highly dependent on critical infrastructures.

This is because a probabilistic risk assessment cannot reliably model human actions and be applied to intentional acts. Due to the distinctive motivations of third-party damage, an unintentional third-party damage Bayesian Network model and a game-theoretic model on malicious intrusion will therefore be built, to examine the mechanism of pipeline failure caused by this mode.

By studying the game characteristics among SISV elements, this paper proposes the Bayesian Stackelberg SISV game model based on the security incident protection model established. In the game model, the strategies for protective vulnerability and aggressive vulnerability are defined as setting the security layer sub-units and the protective vulnerability levels, and setting the intrusion routes and the aggressive vulnerability levels, respectively. The model optimizes the security system vulnerability levels within the different security layer sub-units, based on the available security resources. Despite being demonstrated via an illustrative case, the defender's return on investment is significantly higher by using the SISV game model, the methodology can easily be tailored to a wide variety of petrochemical plants.},"/>

                    <outline text="abstract = {Since the 9/11 attack in New York in 2001, a lot of attention has been paid to the protection of critical infrastructures. Chemical industries are without doubt critical infrastructures due to their extreme importance for society in combination with their vulnerability. They play important roles in modern-life society, from producing and providing daily necessities such as food and energy, to making modern medicine. They are thus truly essential to our modern way of living. Process plants usually store dangerous goods in large quantities, which may pose an important threat to themselves as well as to their surroundings. Moreover, due to a variety of benefits of scale, process plants tend to build their factories geographically together, potentially aggravating the danger. Therefore, the importance of protecting industrial process plants (including those in the chemical industry, the food industry, the energy industry, and others) cannot be overestimated. Risks caused by human behaviours with the intention to cause losses are defined as security risks. For instance, thieves intentionally intruding a plant for stealing valuable materials, or terrorists maliciously setting a fire on a chemical facility to cause societal fear. Initiators of security events (henceforth, attackers) would intelligently observe the defender’s defence plan and then schedule their attack accordingly. Literature has actually shown how resources can be misallocated if intelligent interactions between the defender and the attacker are not considered. Game theory was developed in the economic domain for modelling both cooperative and competitive behaviours in a multiple actors system. In the last 100 years, game theory has been theoretically improved and practically applied to various domains, such as evolutionary biology, computer science etc. These researches have demonstrated the capability of game theory in modelling intelligent interactions. Several security management systems based on game theory have been developed and deployed in reality, such as the ARMOR system for the Los Angeles airport, the PROTECT system for the US coast guard, etc. In this research, game theory is employed to study the protection of chemical industrial areas. Four models are proposed: i) DAMS – an agent-based modelling and simulation approach for assessing domino effects in chemical plants; ii) CPP game – a game theoretic model for single plant protection; iii) CCP game – a game theoretic model for multiple plants protection, by optimizing patrolling; and iv) PPG – a game theoretic model aiming at optimizing pipeline patrolling within or between chemical plants. These models are briefly explained hereafter.},"/>

Different from other oil and gas supply infrastructures, oil and gas pipelines may be more vulnerable to accidental, natural and intentional threats due to their widespread distribution. Therefore a systematic and thorough review is carried out to investigate safety and security of oil and gas pipelines based on bibliometric analysis. First, a total of 598 publications between 1970 and 2019 related to safety and security of oil and natural gas pipelines was retrieved and refined from the database of Web of Science (WoS). The 598 publications are analyzed by the bibliometric software VOSviewer to obtain the temporal and regional distribution of publications, to identify “productive institutions” and “productive authors”, and create the cooperation networks between institutions and authors. Besides, the evolution of research topics and research methods are identified based on keywords and bibliographic analysis. Moreover, the main research topics and research methods are analyzed to obtain insight into the research evolutions and trends. Risk assessment, leakage, and corrosion are the main topics while QRA, fuzzy theory and the Bayesian network are the most frequently used research methods. To further improve the sustainability of oil and gas pipelines, this study provides and discusses future research needs such as pipeline security, environmental sustainability, pipeline system resilience. According to these results, the research on risk assessment based on Bayesian network and consequence analysis using CFD may increase in the future. Besides, more research and guidelines on pipeline security, resilience, and environmental impacts to better protect pipelines, are expected.},"/>

Unfortunately, due to limited resources and physical dispersion, it is impossible for the system administrator to protect each target all the time. In this research paper, we tackle the problem of cyber and physical attacks on oil pipeline infrastructure by proposing a Stackelberg Security Game of three players: system administrator as a leader, cyber and physical attackers as followers. The novelty of this paper is that we have formulated a real world problem of oil stealing using a game theoretic approach. The game has two different types of targets attacked by two distinct types of adversaries with different motives and who can coordinate to maximize their rewards. The solution to this game assists the system administrator of the oil pipeline cyber-physical system to allocate the cyber security controls for the cyber targets and to assign patrol teams to the pipeline regions efficiently.

The essence of the experiment was to install an unlimited number of cooling elements on the gas pipeline. The purpose of this study was to determine at what distance it is possible to install cooling elements for the optimal gas pumping regime, regarding the synthesis of the control law and the determination of the optimal location and assessment of control error depending on the location of the cooling elements.

These conflicts can show up under many situations and market conditions, such as partnerships, joint development, optimal outputs and reserve maximization. Game theory is known as a methodology that improves the decision-making processes by better understanding the players’ specific motivations, strategic interactions and payoff estimation. A widely used framework for modeling social and economic phenomena is the 2 x 2 strategic games, of which include classical forms such as Prisoner’s Dilemma, Stag Hunt, and Battle of Sexes. Therefore, this paper proposes to examine relevant realistic and real-world cases of the oil and gas industry in the form of 2 x 2 strategic games, aiming to investigate game theory approaches to aid in the discussion and resolution of the main dilemmas faced.},"/>

We start by briefly discussing the common application areas that are addressed in the literature, although our focus in this review lies heavily in the approaches that have been adopted to model and solve attacker-defender games. In studying these approaches, we begin by analyzing the following features of the proposed game formulations: the sequence of moves, number of players, nature of decision variables and objective functions, and time horizons. We then analyze the common assumptions of perfect rationality, risk neutrality, and complete information that are enforced within the majority of the articles, and report on state-of-the-art research which has begun relaxing these assumptions. We find that relaxing these assumptions presents further challenges, such as enforcing new assumptions regarding how uncertainties are modeled, and issues with intractability when models are reformulated to account for considerations such as risk preferences. Finally, we examine the methods that have been adopted to solve attacker-defender games. We find that the majority of the articles obtain closed-form solutions to their models, while there are also many articles that developed novel solution algorithms and heuristics. Upon synthesizing and analyzing the literature, we expose open questions in the field, and present promising future research directions that can advance current knowledge.},"/>

A Socio-political index is defined and embedded in an innovative and comprehensive assessment method, considering the effects of social, economic and political elements on pipeline attractiveness and vulnerability. After having analysed the security threats, security measures, aimed at increasing the security level of a pipeline system, are assessed by using a game-theory model. The pipeline segments which are the most probable to be attacked are determined. In addition, having assessed the possible outcomes of attacks to each segment, the security of different segments of specific pipeline routes can be further improved. Our approach can efficiently allocate limited security resources to decrease the security risk along a pipeline route. It should be noted that although this study focuses on oil and gas pipelines, the proposed methodology could be easily adapted to other pipeline systems.},"/>

Being able to model intelligent interactions between adaptive adversaries and defenders is the main advantage of game theory, while the main criticisms of the usage of game theory is that it is mathematically complicated and that it over-simplifies reality. The ANSI/API standard 780 on Security Risk Assessment for the petroleum and petrochemical industries (abbreviated as the “API SRA methodology”), conversely, provides a systematic approach for obtaining qualitative or semi-quantitative data, and is criticized on its failure at modelling strategic (and intelligent) adversaries. Integration of game theory and the API SRA methodology for improving chemical plant protection is therefore an interesting domain of study. In this paper, the API SRA methodology bridges the gap between “chemical security reality” and “chemical security theory (that is, game theoretic models)”, by providing quantitative inputs for game theoretic models and by reflecting on game theoretic results with respect to industrial practice.},"/>

In recent years, the mathematical tool of game theory, being capable to handle intelligent players, has been used in a variety of ways in terrorism risk assessment. In this article, we analyze the general intrusion detection system in process plants, and propose a game-theoretical model for security management in such plants. Players in our model are assumed to be rational and they play the game with complete information. Both the pure strategy and the mixed strategy solutions are explored and explained.

                        <outline text="abstract = {Abstract   Terrorists often take the chemical clusters as the attacking target because of the adverse impacts of a chemical accident on society and the environment. In addition to some fixed countermeasures, previous studies have verified the feasibility of a patrol in addressing adversarial attacks. However, the previous patrolling practices fail to tackle the terrorist attacking problems in a large-scale area cost-effectively. To further tackle the protection issue with cost-beneficial solutions in a large-scale scenario, i.e., in a chemical cluster, we propose an area-partition-involved collaborative patrolling (APCP) game. We first leverage the proposed greedy deployment algorithm to determine the initial deployment of defenders (patrollers), including the quantity and position of patrol vehicles. Then, the large-scale area is partitioned into multiple smaller areas by using the collaborative idea of static partitioning. In the meantime, corresponding patrolling graphs are constructed based on graphic modeling methods. Finally, the APCP game is built between patrol vehicles (namely defender) and potential terrorists (namely attacker), in which patrol vehicles aim at detecting attack behaviors of terrorists by intelligently scheduling the patrolling routes. After formalizing the problem into a sequential game, we compute the Stackelberg equilibrium through the MultiLPs algorithm. Through case studies of three practical chemical cluster scenarios, the results explicitly show the superiority of our proposed APCP game by saving up to 25.48 \% patrolling costs in a one-shot game compared to the results before partition. As for the collaborative patrolling problem in a large-scale area, the methods and models proposed in this paper can facilitate the management department of chemical clusters with intelligently scheduled patrolling routes, which can effectively reduce the cost of patrollers, and better protect the chemical cluster.},"/>

Patrolling is scheduled for better securing chemical clusters. However, the current patrolling strategies fail on competing with intelligent attackers and therefore can be non-optimal. The so-called chemical cluster patrolling (CCP) game is proposed in this paper. The CCP game employs game theory as a methodology, aiming at randomly but strategically scheduling security patrols in chemical clusters. The patroller and the attacker are modelled as the two rational players in the CCP game. The patroller's strategy is defined as probabilistically traveling within the cluster or patrolling some plants while the attacker's strategy is formulated as a combination of an attack target, the start time of the attack, and the attack scenario to be used. The Stackelberg equilibrium and a robust solution which takes into consideration of the patroller's distribution-free uncertainties on the attacker's parameters are defined for predicting the outcome of the CCP game. Results of the case study indicate that the patrolling strategy suggested by the CCP game outperforms both the fixed patrolling route strategy and the purely randomized patrolling strategy.},"/>

<outline text="Without loss of generality we will use Facebook as an example of a social network adversary. Facebook has the ability to read any message posted by any user as well as monitor user behavior. "/>
<outline text="Even though Facebook has full access to the short text $$t_A$$, there is no way to check if $$t_A$$ corresponds to any secret information, since $$t_A$$ is specifically chosen independently of the secret. The short text need not have any specific structure or be about any specific topic. In fact, $$t_A$$ could be a text that Alice would have posted anyway and therefore it is indistinguishable from any other message in $$\mathcal C^∗$$, in fact Facebook does not even know which server a potential secret is stored on, since this information is part of the key. This means that Facebook can only win the IND-STEGO-game with probability 1/2, and the scheme is thus IND-STEGO-secure under a social network adversary."/>

<outline text="The Internet Provider adversary is assumed to have all the powers of the social media plus the ability to monitor all connections of specific users in their jurisdiction. "/>
<outline text="First, we observe that if none of the parties involved in the protocol (other than Facebook) are under observation the analysis is identical to the social media scenario, and the scheme is IND-STEGO-secure. "/>
<outline text="If at least one other party is under observation, we need a more careful analysis. Without loss of generality we assume that Alice is the one under observation. The adversary (**Adv**) will see that Alice connected to the storage server, i.e, **Adv** will know $$srv$$, which is part of the key. **Adv** can try to use this knowledge to get an advantage in the IND-STEGO-game."/>
<outline text="The IND-STEGO-game proceeds according to Game 1 as follows. (1) **Adv** has access to all the users previous messages (as well as any arbitrary message). (2) **Adv** submits a secret message $$m_{Adv}$$ to $$Ch$$ and $$Ch$$ must now return a stego-object. This involves computing the MAC of an independently chosen short text $$t_{Ch}$$, to obtain a username and password, then upload a secret (either $$m_{Adv}$$ or random data, chosen with probability 1/2) to the storage server $$srv$$, and make the secret accessible using the newly created username and password. After that the stego-object $$t_{Ch}$$ is returned to Adv. (3) Adv must now guess if the secret on the storage server is $$m_{Adv}$$ or not."/>
<outline text="Having $$A$$ under observation, **Adv** knows the location of the storage server $$srv$$, but assuming the connection between $$A$$ and $$srv$$ is secure, **Adv** learns nothing about the data exchanged between $$A$$ and $$srv$$. **Adv** learns nothing by supplying an incorrect username and password to the storage server, and **Adv** cannot create the username and password without knowledge of the MAC-key. Guessing the username and password corresponds to guessing the output of the MAC, which can only be done with probability $$1/2^n$$, where n is the number of bits of the MAC output. Since $$1/2^n$$ is negligible the protocol is IND-STEGO-secure."/>

The security of the stego-system presented is in terms of the relative entropy between the distribution of the stego-text and the cover-text. \cite{@Thomas1999} described a model which includes a characterization and definitions of two critical components of a steganographic system, the encoding process and the adversaries attack on the stego-object. The definition of the two components is based on a requirement in the maximum distortion between cover-object, stego-object and the modified stego-object.

<outline text="Security Analysis As mentioned earlier, our proposed scheme is an example of a low-entropy stego-system. We now prove that it is **IND-STEGO-**secure, by measuring the advantage an adversary Adv has in wining the **IND-STEGO-**game. We consider two different adversaries (defined in Section II): the Online social network adversary and the Internet Provider adversary."/>
<outline text="Online Social Network. ">
    <outline text="Without loss of generality we will use Facebook as an example of a social network adversary. Facebook has the ability to read any message posted by any user as well as monitor user behavior. "/>
    <outline text="Even though Facebook has full access to the short text $$t_A$$, there is no way to check if $$t_A$$ corresponds to any secret information, since $$t_A$$ is specifically chosen independently of the secret. The short text need not have any specific structure or be about any specific topic. In fact, $$t_A$$ could be a text that Alice would have posted anyway and therefore it is indistinguishable from any other message in $$\mathcal C^∗$$, in fact Facebook does not even know which server a potential secret is stored on, since this information is part of the key. This means that Facebook can only win the IND-STEGO-game with probability 1/2, and the scheme is thus IND-STEGO-secure under a social network adversary."/>
</outline>
<outline text="Internet Provider. ">
    <outline text="The Internet Provider adversary is assumed to have all the powers of the social media plus the ability to monitor all connections of specific users in their jurisdiction. "/>
    <outline text="First, we observe that if none of the parties involved in the protocol (other than Facebook) are under observation the analysis is identical to the social media scenario, and the scheme is IND-STEGO-secure. "/>
    <outline text="If at least one other party is under observation, we need a more careful analysis. Without loss of generality we assume that Alice is the one under observation. The adversary (**Adv**) will see that Alice connected to the storage server, i.e, **Adv** will know $$srv$$, which is part of the key. **Adv** can try to use this knowledge to get an advantage in the IND-STEGO-game."/>
    <outline text="The IND-STEGO-game proceeds according to Game 1 as follows. (1) **Adv** has access to all the users previous messages (as well as any arbitrary message). (2) **Adv** submits a secret message $$m_{Adv}$$ to $$Ch$$ and $$Ch$$ must now return a stego-object. This involves computing the MAC of an independently chosen short text $$t_{Ch}$$, to obtain a username and password, then upload a secret (either $$m_{Adv}$$ or random data, chosen with probability 1/2) to the storage server $$srv$$, and make the secret accessible using the newly created username and password. After that the stego-object $$t_{Ch}$$ is returned to Adv. (3) Adv must now guess if the secret on the storage server is $$m_{Adv}$$ or not."/>
    <outline text="Having $$A$$ under observation, **Adv** knows the location of the storage server $$srv$$, but assuming the connection between $$A$$ and $$srv$$ is secure, **Adv** learns nothing about the data exchanged between $$A$$ and $$srv$$. **Adv** learns nothing by supplying an incorrect username and password to the storage server, and **Adv** cannot create the username and password without knowledge of the MAC-key. Guessing the username and password corresponds to guessing the output of the MAC, which can only be done with probability $$1/2^n$$, where n is the number of bits of the MAC output. Since $$1/2^n$$ is negligible the protocol is IND-STEGO-secure."/>

<outline text="Researchers has made efforts by proposing several steganographic methods using images as stego-covers, many of which utilize the Least Significant Bit (LSB) to reduce significant changes in the stego-cover in order to prevent suspicion.

The F5 steganographic algorithm proposed in \cite{@Westfeld2001} foolows the orthodox steganographic approach. The study in \cite{@Westfeld2000} shows that the F5 algorithm is resilient to statistical and visual attacks.

The bayesian Nash equilibrium will be a \textit{triple} of srategies: one for the normal user, another for the malicious user and one for the report receiver. All players want to achieve an optimal payoff where a small deviation on it is less profitable. So, the malicous user want to attack without being identified by the report receiver. As for the report receiver, he want to trust the trustworthy reports  without losing reputation and paying cost of trust because of a false identification."/>

                            <outline text="The first step,as always is to determine the strategies for each player. The report receiver $$r$$ has only two strategies ($$t_r$$,$$\overline{t_r}$$) because he doesn't know the type of the user he's dealing with. In the other hand, user $$u$$ knows his type and the strategies are ($$a_uc_u$$,$$c_uc_u$$), where $$a_uc_u$$ means (\textit{attack if malicious,cooperate if normal}) and $$c_uc_u$$ means  (\textit{cooperate if malicious,cooperate if normal}). The reason the strategy has to specify actions for both types is roughly analogous for the reason the strategy has to specify a complete plan for action in extensive-form games with complete information: the user's optimal action depends on what report receiver will do, which in turn depends on what user would have done. Here, user know his type which is, say malicious. So why should he bother formulating a strategy (The strategy $$a_uc_u$$) for the (non-existant) case where he is normal ? The answer is that to decide what is optimal, he has to predict what report receiver will do. However, report receiver doesn't know his type, so he will be optimizing on the basis of his expectations about what a malicous player would optimally do and what a normal player would optimally do. In other words, the strategy of the malicous player  really represents report receiver expectations. And this is the reason why strategies are composed of two components, where the first component of each pair tells his what to do if he is the malicioustype, and the second component if he is the normal type.

A similarity transformation $$P$$ is computed, such that $$J=P^{-1}AP$$ is in Jordan normal form. The matrix key $$P$$ is then encrypted, using a transposition cipher $$E$$ with a secret key. Here, the key is a sequence of $$k$$ integers corresponding to a permutation $$\pi$$ of columns of $$P$$. The public data are then the list [$$E_K(P),J$$] and the secret information is $$\pi$$. The threshold scheme is designed by using $$k$$ instances of an ideal secret sharing scheme such as Shamir’s scheme #cite:shamir1979share to share $$\pi$$ with $$n$$ users."/>

                    <outline text="This method is presented in \cite{yang2009short}. In order to realise an  online $$(k,n)$$ threshold scheme, the secret  $$s$$ is divided into $$k^2$$ chunks of the same size which are then placed into a matrix  $$A$$ according to some scheme. A similarity transformation  $$T$$ is computed, such that  $$J=T^{-1}AT$$ is in Jordan normal form.  This similarity transformation could be viewed as a generalised Hill-cipher \cite{trappe2006introduction} defined for matrices, consisting of a modular matrix left- and right-multiplication, using  $$T$$ as the key. The matrix key $$T$$ is then encrypted itself, using a transposition cipher  $$E_K$$ with key $$K$$. Here, $$K$$ is a sequence of $$k$$ integers correcsponding to a permutation of columns of $$T$$. The public data are then the protected matrix key  $$E_K(T)$$ as well as $$J$$, and the secret part is the key $$K$$. The threshold scheme is designed by using $$k$$ instances of an ideal secret sharing scheme such as Shamir to share $$K$$ between $$n$$ users."/>
                    <outline text="In order to reconstruct the secret, a coalition of  $$k$$ players combine their shares in order to recover  $$K$$. From this, they can deduce  $$T$$ and $$A=TJT^{-1}$$, and finally  $$s$$. This shows the correctness of the scheme."/>

                    <outline text="In order to provide optimal security, weak (low entropy) keys must be avoided. Usually, this is achieved by asserting that keys are uniformly distributed random numbers. It is clear that the secret part (the key  $$K$$) is uniformly distributed random data, although the size of the key must be suficiently large and hence for small threshold values $$k$$ this method would not be secure. However, a more careful analysis shows that this is not the case with the public part. In the discussed method, the matrix key  $$T$$ is generated by the algorithm computing the Jordan normal form itself, and as simple counterexamples show\footnote{For example}, the set of similarity transformations will not be uniformly distributed over the set of all $$r$$ by $$r$$ matrices. Also, the problem of determining the conjugation classes with respect to similarity transformations, of matrices over a finite field, seems difficult \cite{fulman2002random} and hence the precise distribution of $$J$$ is unknown."/>
                    <outline text="The authors of the paper prove that knowing $$E_K(T)$$ and $$J$$ gives as much information about the secret matrix $$A$$ as can be encoded in the transformation $$T$$. Using information theory, this can be expressed as"/>

The cost for reconstructing the secret requires polynomial interpolation and $$O(k^3)$$ field operations for implementing the similarity transformation."/>

<outline text="The principal idea of non-cooperative game theory is to consider rational players, choosing between actions that entail payoffs consisting of gains (benefits) and losses (costs), in order to form __optimal strategies__ seeking to maximise their payoffs. A game is solved using the fundamental concept of the Nash Equilibrium, as described in Section \ref{sec:scheduling_game}."/>
<outline text="An optimal Nash Equilibrium (NE) strategy has a local maximum property: any single player deviating from a NE strategy will suffer a reduced payoff. It is important to note that only unilateral strategy changes are considered in this concept. Hence applying game theory for real-life scenarios is only a valid and useful tool if all participants agree to adopt it as a rule for strategic decision-making, in the modelled scenario. #wfe-ignore-item " complete="true"/>
<outline text="__Zero-sum__ games are used for simple scenarios where it can be assumed that the gains or losses of one player are balanced out by those for the remaining ones. For more complex scenarios, __nonzero-sum__ games may be required. A nonzero-sum game may not have any clear winner or looser, and its NE strategies may not necessarily be unique, implying that different optimal strategies with different payoffs exist. An NE strategy whose payoff is largest amongst all other optimal solutions, is referred to as __globally optimal solution__." complete="true"/>
<outline text="An arbitrary game need not always have to have optimal solutions following the above definition, and this can be resolved using the more general idea of mixed strategies. Mixed strategies extend pure strategies by introducing probability distributions. Nash's theorem then states that any $$n$$-player non-cooperative game not possessing a pure NE admits a mixed NE. Mixed strategies are very relevant in the context of security games, as most of these games do not have pure NEs. On the other hand, the practical interpretation of mixed NES remains controversial  \cite{} \Eckhard{Fariborz, could ypu please add this reference: Aumann, R. (1985) What Is Game Theory Trying to Accomplish?

In a complete information game, parties have full knowledge of the complete set of strategies and corresponding payoffs of all players and the specific selection of actions is based on computing optimal solutions, relying on everyone else proceeding in the same way."/>
                            <outline text="The game is inspired by the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) game of \cite{Alpcan2010} which has been thoroughly analysed in the literature and is well understood. Table \ref{table:game_IDS} illustrates the game where the two strategies available to the defender are to monitor or not, denoted by the strategy space $$S_\mathcal{D} = \{s^\mathcal{D}_{mon},s^\mathcal{D}_{-mon}\}$$, and the attacker chooses between attacking or not attacking: $$S_\mathcal{A} = \{s^\mathcal{A}_{att},s^{\mathcal{A}}_{- att}\}$$. The positive parameters $$\alpha_c, \alpha_f, \alpha_m, \beta_c$$ and $$\beta_s$$ are used to denote the payoffs corresponding to the various strategies. The main characteristic of this game is the design of the payoff functions in such a way that the monitoring defender only has an incentive to defend in the presence of an attack.

<outline text="In this section, an augmented security game is introduced, extending the IDS game introduced in the previous section by an additional action. The rationale behind this extended game model is twofold: Section \ref{sys_monitor} demonstrated the existence of low-impact attacks which cannot be detected by standard monitoring techniques, and it would be desirable to capture these in a more sophisticated game model. Second, an extended game might better match real-world scenarios and might lead to simpler solutions, in this case pure equilibria rather than mixed ones. " complete="true"/>
<outline text="Game Strategies #h4 " complete="true">
    <outline text="Section #wfe-latex-ref:vulnerability_section presented three possible monitoring strategies for $$\mathcal{U}$$: to monitor the daily average of forecasting data, to inspect the daily shape of the aggregated forecast, and to inspect the individual forecast data with the same level of detail. In this paper, the assumption is made that the first and second monitoring strategies are most useful in a realistic setting, as they have an observable impact on the strength and outcome of successful attacks while the third monitoring strategy merely eliminates attacks that are possible for weaker monitoring levels. Furthermore, as the data of aggregated forecasts is readily available to the utility company, the first monitoring strategy is not very costly and will be identified with the strategy $$s^\mathcal{U}_{-mon}$$. The second monitoring strategy will be denoted as $$ s^\mathcal{U}_{mon}$$ so that the strategy space for the defender $$\mathcal{U}$$ is as in the previous game $$S_\mathcal{U} = \{s^\mathcal{U}_{mon},s^\mathcal{U}_{-mon}\}$$. The attacker $$\mathcal{A}$$ has three different strategies: to attack strongly with high impact, to perform a weaker attack with low impact, or not to attack at all. This will be denoted by the strategy space $$S_\mathcal{A} = \{s^\mathcal{A}_{att},s^\mathcal{A}_{att^*},s^{\mathcal{A}}_{- att}\}$$. " complete="true"/>
    <outline text="The additional weak attack strategy $$s^\mathcal{A}_{att^*}$$ offers an alternative incentive of not monitoring to the utility company, preferring to save monitoring cost when facing a weak attack. No assumption is made on the relationship between the attacker's overall payoff when choosing the two different attack types, and a discussion of conditions clarifying this relationship will be the main subject of the game analysis in the next section." complete="true"/>

<outline text="Game Payoff Functions #h4 " complete="true">
    <outline text="The following notations for the payoffs for $$\mathcal{U}$$ are introduced: $$c^\mathcal{U}_{mon}$$ is the cost for monitoring  the daily shape of the aggregated forecast (second monitoring strategy) and $$c^\mathcal{U}_{def}$$ is an additonal cost for investing in defense mechanisms such as actions discussed in Section \ref{attack_mitigation}. Losses from weak and strong attacks are denoted by $$l^\mathcal{U}_{att^*}$$ and $$l^\mathcal{U}_{att}$$ respecively. The payoff functions corresponding to $$\mathcal{A}$$ are the benefits and costs associated with weak and strong attacks, denoted by $$b^\mathcal{A}_{att^*} $$, $$c^\mathcal{A}_{att^*}$$ as well as $$b^\mathcal{A}_{att} $$ and $$c^\mathcal{A}_{att}$$.

    <outline text="The monitoring activity always leads to monitoring costs for $$\mathcal{U}$$. If there is no monitoring, $$\mathcal{U}$$ incurs losses $$l_{att^*}^{\mathcal{U}}$$ and $$l_{att}^{\mathcal{U}}$$ due to weak and strong attacks. Otherwise, despite monitoring, weak attacks cannot be detected, hence there is a resulting loss $$l_{att^*}^{\mathcal{U}}$$. Strong attacks however are detected and mitigated against through some countermeasures, preventing any losses but leading to a defence cost $$c^\mathcal{U}_{def}$$. Finally, if there is no attack, then the only arising non-zero payoff function involved is the monitoring cost for $$\mathcal{U}$$. The attacker $$\mathcal{A}$$ obtains a benefit $$b^\mathcal{A}_{att^*} $$ from a weak attack, but has to invest attack costs $$c^\mathcal{A}_{att^*} $$. Similarly, the cost $$c^\mathcal{A}_{att} $$ arises from a strong attack, however the model assumes the lack of a benefit for $$\mathcal{A}$$ due to the utility company's defence mechanism. Note that in order to aid the game analysis, an assumption made in this game is that the benefit of the attacker is the loss of the defender, $$b^\mathcal{A}_{att^*}=l_{att^*}^{\mathcal{U}}$$ and $$b^\mathcal{A}_{att}=l_{att}^{\mathcal{U}}$$. \Eckhard{jc, in response to your comment, in the IDS game this is not applicable since it does not have this level of detail.

    <outline text="\label{IDS_Assumptions}"/>
    <outline text="As in \cite{Alpcan2010}, all game parameters are positive. The cost for missing an attack $$\alpha_m={l}^{\mathcal{U}}_{att} &gt; 0$$ is interpreted as losses from an attack that is not mitigated against, the false alarm cost $$\alpha_f=c^{\mathcal{U}}_{mon} &gt;0$$ as an ongoing monitoring cost and the detection penalty $$\beta_c=c^{\mathcal{A}}_{att} &gt; 0$$ as the cost for the attacker to conduct a strong attack. The gain from detection $$\alpha_c = -c^{\mathcal{U}}_{mon}-c^{\mathcal{U}}_{def} &gt; 0$$ is reformulated as necessary cost to monitor and to defend in order to prevent damage. In order to preserve the mixed equilibrium property of the security game given by $$-\alpha_m &lt; \alpha_c$$ it is then assumed that this defense cost is less than actual incurring attack damage, i.e.~$$c^\mathcal{U}_{mon} + c^\mathcal{U}_{def} &lt; l^\mathcal{U}_{att}$$. This assumption is natural as, in a typical security game, the defender does not spend more on defence than what they can loose from an attack. Finally, $$\beta_s={{l}}^{\mathcal{U}}_{att} - c^{\mathcal{A}}_{att}&gt;0$$ is the difference between the benefit from an undetected attack and the attack effort. This expresses a similar principle as above, but this time applied to the attacker $$\mathcal{A}$$ who will not spend more on an attack than the expected gain from it. These assumptions will be referred to as Security Game Assumptions. "/>

This interpretation weakens the predictive power of Nash equilibrium, however, since it is possible in such an equilibrium for each player to actually play a pure strategy of Rock."/>

<outline text="The principal idea of non-cooperative game theory is to consider rational players, choosing between actions that entail payoffs consisting of gains (benefits) and losses (costs), in order to form optimal strategies seeking to maximise their payoffs. A game is solved using the fundamental concept of the Nash Equilibrium. An optimal Nash Equilibrium (NE) strategy has a local maximum property: any single player deviating from the NE strategy will suffer a reduced payoff. It is important to note that only unilateral strategy changes are considered in this concept. Hence applying game theory for real-life scenarios is only a valid and useful tool if all participants agree to adopt it as a contract for strategic decision-making, in the modelled scenario. " complete="true"/>
<outline text="Zero-sum games are used for simple scenarios where it can be assumed that the gains or losses of one player are balanced out by those for the remaining ones. For more complex scenarios, nonzero-sum games may be required. A nonzero-sum game may not have any clear winner or looser, and its NE strategies may not necessarily be unique, implying that different optimal strategies with different payoffs exist. An NE strategy whose payoff is largest amongst all other optimal solutions, is referred to as globally optimal solution." complete="true"/>
<outline text="An arbitrary game need not always have to have optimal solutions following the above definition, and this can be resolved using the more general idea of mixed strategies. Mixed strategies extend pure strategies by introducing probability distributions. Nash's theorem then states that any $$n$$-player non-cooperative game not possessing a pure NE admits a mixed NE. Mixed strategies are very relevant in the context of security games, as most of these games do not have pure NEs. On the other hand, the practical interpretation of mixed NES remains controversial  and for this reason, for the game introduced in this paper, the focus is on pure NEs." complete="true"/>

<outline text="The game is inspired by the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) game of \cite{Alpcan2010} which has been thoroughly analysed in the literature and is well understood. Table \ref{table:game_IDS} illustrates the game where the two strategies available to the defender are to monitor or not, denoted by the strategy space $$S_\mathcal{D} = \{s^\mathcal{D}_{mon},s^\mathcal{D}_{-mon}\}$$, and the attacker chooses between attacking or not attacking: $$S_\mathcal{A} = \{s^\mathcal{A}_{att},s^{\mathcal{A}}_{- att}\}$$. The positive parameters $$\alpha_c, \alpha_f, \alpha_m, \beta_c$$ and $$\beta_s$$ are used to denote the payoffs corresponding to the various strategies. The main characteristic of this game is the design of the payoff functions in such a way that the monitoring defender only has an incentive to defend in the presence of an attack. The attacker is discouraged from attacking if there is defence in place. This design leads to a circular path when considering payoff-incrementing unilateral changes of strategy, hence prohibiting the existence of a pure Nash Equilibrium." complete="true">

Second, an extended game might better match real-world scenarios and might lead to simpler solutions, in this case pure equilibria rather than mixed ones. " complete="true"/>

In this paper, the assumption is made that the first and second monitoring strategies are most useful in a realistic setting, as they have an observable impact on the strength and outcome of successful attacks while the third monitoring strategy merely eliminates attacks that are possible for weaker monitoring levels. Furthermore, as the data of aggregated forecasts is readily available to the utility company, the first monitoring strategy is not very costly and will be identified with the strategy $$s^\mathcal{U}_{-mon}$$. The second monitoring strategy will be denoted as $$ s^\mathcal{U}_{mon}$$ so that the strategy space for the defender $$\mathcal{U}$$ is as in the previous game $$S_\mathcal{U} = \{s^\mathcal{U}_{mon},s^\mathcal{U}_{-mon}\}$$. The attacker $$\mathcal{A}$$ has three different strategies: to attack strongly with high impact, to perform a weaker attack with low impact, or not to attack at all.

Strong attacks however are detected and mitigated against through some countermeasures, preventing any losses but leading to a defence cost $$c^\mathcal{U}_{def}$$.

<outline text="Concept #h3">
    <outline text="The principal idea of non-cooperative game theory is to consider rational players, choosing between actions that entail payoffs consisting of gains (benefits) and losses (costs), in order to form optimal strategies seeking to maximise their payoffs. A game is solved using the fundamental concept of the Nash Equilibrium. An optimal Nash Equilibrium (NE) strategy has a local maximum property: any single player deviating from the NE strategy will suffer a reduced payoff. It is important to note that only unilateral strategy changes are considered in this concept. Hence applying game theory for real-life scenarios is only a valid and useful tool if all participants agree to adopt it as a contract for strategic decision-making, in the modelled scenario. " complete="true"/>
    <outline text="Zero-sum games are used for simple scenarios where it can be assumed that the gains or losses of one player are balanced out by those for the remaining ones. For more complex scenarios, nonzero-sum games may be required. A nonzero-sum game may not have any clear winner or looser, and its NE strategies may not necessarily be unique, implying that different optimal strategies with different payoffs exist. An NE strategy whose payoff is largest amongst all other optimal solutions, is referred to as globally optimal solution." complete="true"/>
    <outline text="An arbitrary game need not always have to have optimal solutions following the above definition, and this can be resolved using the more general idea of mixed strategies. Mixed strategies extend pure strategies by introducing probability distributions. Nash's theorem then states that any $$n$$-player non-cooperative game not possessing a pure NE admits a mixed NE. Mixed strategies are very relevant in the context of security games, as most of these games do not have pure NEs. On the other hand, the practical interpretation of mixed NES remains controversial  and for this reason, for the game introduced in this paper, the focus is on pure NEs." complete="true"/>

<outline text="The game is inspired by the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) game of \cite{Alpcan2010} which has been thoroughly analysed in the literature and is well understood. Table \ref{table:game_IDS} illustrates the game where the two strategies available to the defender are to monitor or not, denoted by the strategy space $$S_\mathcal{D} = \{s^\mathcal{D}_{mon},s^\mathcal{D}_{-mon}\}$$, and the attacker chooses between attacking or not attacking: $$S_\mathcal{A} = \{s^\mathcal{A}_{att},s^{\mathcal{A}}_{- att}\}$$. The positive parameters $$\alpha_c, \alpha_f, \alpha_m, \beta_c$$ and $$\beta_s$$ are used to denote the payoffs corresponding to the various strategies. The main characteristic of this game is the design of the strategic part of the payoff functions in such a way that the monitoring defender only has an incentive to defend in the presence of an attack. The attacker is discouraged from attacking if there is defence in place. This design leads to a circular path when considering payoff-incrementing unilateral changes of strategy, hence prohibiting the existence of a pure Nash Equilibrium." complete="true">

    <outline text="In this section, an augmented security game is introduced, extending the IDS game introduced in the previous section by an additional action. The rationale behind this extended game model is twofold: Section \ref{sys_monitor} demonstrated the existence of a class of weak low-impact attacks which cannot be detected by standard monitoring techniques, and it is desirable to capture these in a more sophisticated game model. Second, an extended game might better match real-world scenarios and might lead to more natural solutions, in this case pure equilibria rather than mixed ones. " complete="true"/>

In this paper, the assumption is made that the first and second monitoring strategies are most useful in a realistic setting, as they have an observable impact on the strength and outcome of successful attacks while the third monitoring strategy merely eliminates attacks that are possible for weaker monitoring levels. Furthermore, as the data of aggregated forecasts is readily available to the utility company, the first monitoring strategy is not very costly and will be identified with the strategy $$s^\mathcal{U}_{-mon}$$. The second monitoring strategy will be denoted as $$ s^\mathcal{U}_{mon}$$ so that the strategy space for the defender $$\mathcal{U}$$ is as in the previous game $$S_\mathcal{U} = \{s^\mathcal{U}_{mon},s^\mathcal{U}_{-mon}\}$$. The attacker $$\mathcal{A}$$ has three different strategies: to attack strongly with high impact, to perform a weaker attack with low impact, or not to attack at all.

        <outline text="The principal idea of non-cooperative game theory is to consider rational players, choosing between actions that entail payoffs consisting of gains (benefits) and losses (costs), in order to form optimal strategies seeking to maximise their payoffs. A game is solved using the fundamental concept of the Nash Equilibrium. An optimal Nash Equilibrium (NE) strategy has a local maximum property: any single player deviating from the NE strategy will suffer a reduced payoff. It is important to note that only unilateral strategy changes are considered in this concept. Hence applying game theory for real-life scenarios is only a valid and useful tool if all participants agree to adopt it as a contract for strategic decision-making, in the modelled scenario. " complete="true"/>
        <outline text="Zero-sum games are used for simple scenarios where it can be assumed that the gains or losses of one player are balanced out by those for the remaining ones. For more complex scenarios, nonzero-sum games may be required. A nonzero-sum game may not have any clear winner or looser, and its NE strategies may not necessarily be unique, implying that different optimal strategies with different payoffs exist. An NE strategy whose payoff is largest amongst all other optimal solutions, is referred to as globally optimal solution." complete="true"/>
        <outline text="An arbitrary game need not always have to have optimal solutions following the above definition, and this can be resolved using the more general idea of mixed strategies. Mixed strategies extend pure strategies by introducing probability distributions. Nash's theorem then states that any $$n$$-player non-cooperative game not possessing a pure NE admits a mixed NE. Mixed strategies are very relevant in the context of security games, as most of these games do not have pure NEs. On the other hand, the practical interpretation of mixed NES remains controversial  and for this reason, for the game introduced in this paper, the focus is on pure NEs." complete="true"/>

        <outline text="The game is inspired by the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) game of \cite{Alpcan2010} which has been thoroughly analysed in the literature and is well understood. Table \ref{table:game_IDS} illustrates the game where the two strategies available to the defender are to monitor or not, denoted by the strategy space $$S_\mathcal{D} = \{s^\mathcal{D}_{mon},s^\mathcal{D}_{-mon}\}$$, and the attacker chooses between attacking or not attacking: $$S_\mathcal{A} = \{s^\mathcal{A}_{att},s^{\mathcal{A}}_{- att}\}$$. The positive parameters $$\alpha_c, \alpha_f, \alpha_m, \beta_c$$ and $$\beta_s$$ are used to denote the payoffs corresponding to the various strategies. The main characteristic of this game is the design of the payoff functions in such a way that the monitoring defender only has an incentive to defend in the presence of an attack. The attacker is discouraged from attacking if there is defence in place. This design leads to a circular path when considering payoff-incrementing unilateral changes of strategy, hence prohibiting the existence of a pure Nash Equilibrium." complete="true">

Second, an extended game might better match real-world scenarios and might lead to simpler solutions, in this case pure equilibria rather than mixed ones. " complete="true"/>

In this paper, the assumption is made that the first and second monitoring strategies are most useful in a realistic setting, as they have an observable impact on the strength and outcome of successful attacks while the third monitoring strategy merely eliminates attacks that are possible for weaker monitoring levels. Furthermore, as the data of aggregated forecasts is readily available to the utility company, the first monitoring strategy is not very costly and will be identified with the strategy $$s^\mathcal{U}_{-mon}$$. The second monitoring strategy will be denoted as $$ s^\mathcal{U}_{mon}$$ so that the strategy space for the defender $$\mathcal{U}$$ is as in the previous game $$S_\mathcal{U} = \{s^\mathcal{U}_{mon},s^\mathcal{U}_{-mon}\}$$. The attacker $$\mathcal{A}$$ has three different strategies: to attack strongly with high impact, to perform a weaker attack with low impact, or not to attack at all.

Strong attacks however are detected and mitigated against through some countermeasures, preventing any losses but leading to a defence cost $$c^\mathcal{U}_{def}$$. Finally, if there is no attack, then the only arising non-zero payoff function involved is the monitoring cost for $$\mathcal{U}$$. The attacker $$\mathcal{A}$$ obtains a benefit $$b^\mathcal{A}_{weak} $$ from a weak attack, but has to invest attack costs $$c^\mathcal{A}_{weak} $$.

The positive parameters $$\alpha_c, \alpha_f, \alpha_m, \beta_c$$ and $$\beta_s$$ are used to denote the payoffs corresponding to the various strategies. The main characteristic of this game is the design of the payoff functions in such a way that the monitoring defender only has an incentive to defend in the presence of an attack.

The rationale behind this extended game model is twofold: Section \ref{sys_monitor} demonstrated the existence of low-impact attacks which cannot be detected by standard monitoring techniques, and it would be desirable to capture these in a more sophisticated game model. Second, an extended game might better match real-world scenarios and might lead to simpler solutions, in this case pure equilibria rather than mixed ones. " complete="true"/>

In this paper, the assumption is made that the first and second monitoring strategies are most useful in a realistic setting, as they have an observable impact on the strength and outcome of successful attacks while the third monitoring strategy merely eliminates attacks that are possible for weaker monitoring levels. Furthermore, as the data of aggregated forecasts is readily available to the utility company, the first monitoring strategy is not very costly and will be identified with the strategy $$s^\mathcal{U}_{-mon}$$. The second monitoring strategy will be denoted as $$ s^\mathcal{U}_{mon}$$ so that the strategy space for the defender $$\mathcal{U}$$ is as in the previous game $$S_\mathcal{U} = \{s^\mathcal{U}_{mon},s^\mathcal{U}_{-mon}\}$$.

    <outline text="The principal idea of non-cooperative game theory is to consider rational players, choosing between actions that entail payoffs consisting of gains (benefits) and losses (costs), in order to form optimal strategies seeking to maximise their payoffs. A game is solved using the fundamental concept of the Nash Equilibrium. An optimal Nash Equilibrium (NE) strategy has a local maximum property: any single player deviating from the NE strategy will suffer a reduced payoff. It is important to note that only unilateral strategy changes are considered in this concept. Hence applying game theory for real-life scenarios is only a valid and useful tool if all participants agree to adopt it as a contract for strategic decision-making, in the modelled scenario.

    <outline text="Zero-sum games are used for simple scenarios where it can be assumed that the gains or losses of one player are balanced out by those for the remaining ones. For more complex scenarios, nonzero-sum games may be required. A nonzero-sum game may not have any clear winner or looser, and its NE strategies may not necessarily be unique, implying that different optimal strategies with different payoffs exist. An NE strategy whose payoff is largest amongst all other optimal solutions, is referred to as globally optimal solution." complete="true"/>
    <outline text="An arbitrary game need not always have to have optimal solutions following the above definition, and this can be resolved using the more general idea of mixed strategies. Mixed strategies extend pure strategies by introducing probability distributions. Nash's theorem then states that any $$n$$-player non-cooperative game not possessing a pure NE admits a mixed NE. Mixed strategies are very relevant in the context of security games, as most of these games do not have pure NEs. On the other hand, the practical interpretation of mixed NES remains controversial  and for this reason, for the game introduced in this paper, the focus is on pure NEs." complete="true"/>

Table \ref{table:game_IDS} illustrates the game where the two strategies available to the defender are to monitor or not, denoted by the strategy space $$S_\mathcal{D} = \{s^\mathcal{D}_{mon},s^\mathcal{D}_{-mon}\}$$, and the attacker chooses between attacking or not attacking: $$S_\mathcal{A} = \{s^\mathcal{A}_{att},s^{\mathcal{A}}_{- att}\}$$. The positive parameters $$\alpha_c, \alpha_f, \alpha_m, \beta_c$$ and $$\beta_s$$ are used to denote the payoffs corresponding to the various strategies. The main characteristic of this game is the design of the strategic part of the payoff functions in such a way that the monitoring defender only has an incentive to defend in the presence of an attack. The attacker is discouraged from attacking if there is defence in place.

    <outline text="In this section, an augmented security game is introduced, extending the IDS game introduced in the previous section by an additional action. The rationale behind this extended game model is twofold: Section \ref{sys_monitor} demonstrated the existence of a class of weak low-impact attacks which cannot be detected by standard monitoring techniques, and it is desirable to capture these in a more sophisticated game model. Second, an extended game might better match real-world scenarios and might lead to more natural solutions, in this case pure equilibria rather than mixed ones. " complete="true"/>

In this paper, the assumption is made that the first and second monitoring strategies are most useful in a realistic setting, as they have an observable impact on the strength and outcome of successful attacks while the third monitoring strategy merely eliminates attacks that are possible for weaker monitoring levels. Furthermore, as the data of aggregated forecasts is readily available to the utility company, the first monitoring strategy is not very costly and will be identified with the strategy $$s^\mathcal{U}_{-mon}$$. The second monitoring strategy will be denoted as $$ s^\mathcal{U}_{mon}$$ so that the strategy space for the defender $$\mathcal{U}$$ is as in the previous game $$S_\mathcal{U} = \{s^\mathcal{U}_{mon},s^\mathcal{U}_{-mon}\}$$. The attacker $$\mathcal{A}$$ has three different strategies: to attack strongly with high impact, to perform a weaker attack with low impact, or not to attack at all.
