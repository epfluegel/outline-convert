            <outline text="The **von Neumann growth model** is an economic model that describes long-term economic expansion based on productive processes and resource allocation. It connects closely to the general economic terminology we discussed:"/>
            <outline text="**Economy** – The von Neumann model represents an economy as a system of interdependent industries where production processes determine economic expansion. The model focuses on achieving a balanced growth rate for the entire economy.">
              <outline text="**Industry** – The model assumes multiple industries that produce different goods using various production techniques. Each industry contributes to overall economic growth through efficient resource utilization."/>
              <outline text="**Sector** – Different economic sectors interact in the von Neumann model, with some sectors producing raw materials, others manufacturing capital goods, and others providing consumer products. Their interdependence drives economic expansion.">
                <outline text="**Goods** – Goods in this model include both consumer and capital goods, which industries produce using available resources. Capital goods (such as machines and tools) are particularly important, as they enable further production."/>
                <outline text="**Production** – A key aspect of the von Neumann model is that production relies on inputs (resources and capital) to generate outputs. The model assumes that production functions exhibit constant returns to scale, meaning that output increases proportionally with input."/>
                <outline text="**Cost** – The model incorporates the idea of efficiency, where industries must minimize costs by optimizing input use. It assumes that resources flow to the most productive sectors, ensuring maximum economic growth."/>
              </outline>
            </outline>
            <outline text="In summary, the von Neumann growth model uses mathematical principles to explain how industries, goods, production, and costs interact to drive long-term economic growth. It highlights the importance of efficient resource allocation and technological progress in sustaining economic expansion."/>

            <outline text="The **von Neumann economic growth model** explains how economies optimize resource allocation and technological progress to achieve sustainable expansion, ensuring efficient use and potential **reuse** of goods in a cyclical economic system."/>

              <outline text="Introduced by John von Neumann in 1937 \cite{}."/>

              <outline text="Societies operate within an **economy**, where different **sectors** (such as agriculture, manufacturing, and technology) consist of various **industries** that produce and distribute **goods**. "/>
              <outline text="These industries rely on **resources** (such as raw materials, labor, and energy) and **capital** (such as machinery, infrastructure, and investments) to drive **production**. "/>

              <outline text="Economy is the broader system that encompasses all industries, businesses, and activities related to the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. "/>
              <outline text="It includes everything from agriculture and manufacturing to technology and finance.  "/>
              <outline text="Sector refers to a broad division of the economy that groups related industries together, such as the agriculture sector, manufacturing sector, or service sector, each contributing to overall economic activity in different ways."/>
              <outline text="Industry refers to a specific sector of the economy that produces goods or services. For example, the automobile industry produces cars, while the textile industry makes clothing.  "/>

              <outline text="Goods are physical products that industries produce for consumption or further use. These can range from consumer goods (like clothing and electronics) to capital goods (like machinery used in production).  "/>
              <outline text="Production is the process of creating goods and services. It involves using resources such as labour, raw materials, and technology to transform inputs into finished products. The efficiency and scale of production influence the overall performance of industries and the economy.  "/>
              <outline text="Cost represents the expenses incurred during production, including raw materials, labour, machinery, and overhead. The cost of production affects pricing, profitability, and competitiveness within an industry and the economy as a whole.  "/>
