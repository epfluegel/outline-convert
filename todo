Here are somme suggestions:

- Move the logic of image and links (markdown) in the markdown function

- Remove "[COMPLETE]" because the "[COMPLETE]" at the beginning of an item is seen as an optionnal argument of \item.

- Use subtitle on frame for title notes

The next steps:

- Implement --add-new-line

- Implement those output formats: 'rtf', 'docx'
