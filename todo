[DONE] Consider tags or not : --expert-mode
tabs : -t none space tab
[DONE] output format : -f opml txt latex-a(article) latex-b(beamer)
strip tags : -s By default keep every tags
[DONE] output name : -o  Default name?
[DONE] If no -o --> stdout
clipboard copy and paste

default argument file name. Do not look at the extension name but analyse the content

Default execution : whatever file into opml




if no -o given, write everything in stdout --> stdout option is now useless


The escaping issue can come from the opml treatment maybe there will be another escape function. Indeed the opml to latex is not working well

Txt to Txt OK
Txt to opml FIXED
Txt to Latex-a IMPROVED with the package for <> etc
Txt to Latex-b OK warning: underfull vbox badness
Txt to Latex-b expert 80% FIXED the escaping after converting the tags but no specific tags tested. When there is no tag for a title
it should create its own slide but it is not the case now

Opml to Txt OK
Opml to Opml OK
Opml to Latex-a

Need to see how the sub sub section work because for now it is deleted but we may want a titla or so
Are section just to organise the slides and the parts of the presentation?
