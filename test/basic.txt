- Assets #CI7100 #CI7130_Intro #slide #CI7160-intro #basic
  - In order to better understand security attacks, we have to define what we want to protect
  - This is called an asset
  - We categorise assets in the following way:
- Assets #slide #CI7100 #CI7130_Intro #CI6240_SM-1 #basic

- Mini-Exercise: Assets #slide #CI7100 #CI7130_Intro #basic
  - Look around you. There are many assets of the Kingston University system present. List some asset items, with at least one in each category.
  - Which of them do you consider being critical assets -- these would be assets of particular value or importance for your student experience.
- The Goals of Computer Security #slide #CI7100 #CI7160-intro #CI7130_Intro #basic
  - We will define as the main goals (or requirements) of Computer Security (“CIA”):
  - This terminology is adopted by academia and industry
  - Note: cannot “guarantee” absolute security
- Confidentiality #slide #CI7100 #CI7160-intro #CI7130_Intro #basic
  - Definition: computer related assets must be accessed only by authorised parties
  - Synonyms: secrecy, privacy
  - Example: you need to prevent hackers from accessing personal data in your social network account
  - There may be different levels of confidentiality for different users
- Integrity #slide #CI7100 #CI7160-intro #CI7130_Intro #basic
  - Data Integrity:
  - Origin Integrity (Authentication):
  - Non-repudiation:
- Availability #slide #CI7100 #CI7160-intro #CI7130_Intro #basic
  - Definition: assets are accessible to authorised parties at appropriate times
  - In other words: legitimate access should always be possible
  - Example: a website should be available 24/7.
  - Different availability levels
- Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability #slide #CI7100 #CI7160-intro #CI7130_Intro #basic

- Threats, Vulnerabilities, Attacks and Risks #slide #CI7100 #CI7160-intro #CI7130_Intro #basic
  - Threat: set of circumstances with potential to exploit vulnerability and create a risk of harm
  - Vulnerability: potentially exploitable weakness of an asset
  - Attack: realisation of a threat ("threat event")
  - Risk: occurs if “matching” threat and vulnerability exist
- Controls #slide #CI7100 #CI7160-intro #CI7130_Intro #basic
  - A control is used for protection.
  - It could be for example an
  - It either eliminates the threat and/or closes the vulnerability.
  - Controls need to be effective.
- #todo Basic Security Methodology #slide #CI6240_SM-1 #CI7100 #CI7160_D1 #CI7130_Intro #basic
  - The basic methodology in computer security is:
  - Impossible to guarantee security, can only minimise risk
  - Need for periodic review
- Generic Security Methodology #slide #CI7160-intro
  - For each critical asset do:
  - Constant re-evaluation is necessary
- Mini-Exercise: Security Goals #slide:mini #CI7100 #CI7130_Intro #basic
  - Read the story about the recent security incident at [The Register](https://www.theregister.co.uk/security/).
  - Analyse the story more in-depth (you may have to research older, related articles) and identify which of the main security goals were violated, and of which (critical) assets.
