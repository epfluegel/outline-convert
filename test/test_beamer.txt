    - Ready for Change: Achieving Improved Security Behaviour
      - Overview
        - Computer, network and cyber security are increasingly attracting attention by the popular media, mirroring their growing importance for everyday computer use by both individuals and organisations. Whilst cyber security can be defined as the assessment of, responding to and monitoring of the security of the cyberspace, it is difficult to pin down to one single scientific discipline, but rather relates to a number of domains and fields such as physical security, network security, security assessment frameworks and the human element.
        - It is commonly agreed in the literature that sound security technology can only be designed, implemented and used if a healthy security culture is present throughout these different stages. In particular, cyber-awareness of individual users will determine their behaviour and create typical vulnerabilities such as following links sent via email and other channels, e.g. Skype and whatsapp, opening PDFs or  installing software such as executables and browser toolbars that may create software vulnerabilities. Consequently, individuals will be exposed to a great range of cyber security threats, for example 'long cons' as intensive and sustained attempt to achieve a substantial exploit, or 'short cons' such as getting children to click on a link that charges their parents' phone.
        - Hence, an important security control this the ensuring of security responsible behaviour through behavioural change frameworks, which are the focus of this dissertation project.
      - Aims and Objectives
        - The overarching aim of the project is to find mechanisms, frameworks, tools and applications (in particular, "gamification" using mobile apps) to induce behavioural change towards increased cyber-awareness and more cyber-wise computer use in people. This could be generic users, or perhaps a specific type of user group such as older adults, or employees in an organisation.
        - The following objectives are proposed:
        - - To thoroughly review the literature of proposed behavioural change methods in the context of cyber-awareness. This review will include disciplines such as psychology, behavioural science and HCI.
        - - To create a framework for behavioural change to cyber-wise/cyber awareness, based on the established model (KU)
        - - To investigate the design and implementation of a prototype mechanism for carrying out such a change
        - - Potentially to evaluate the solution.
      - The aims of the project are to first of all investigate mechanisms, frameworks, tools and applications (in particular, "gamification" using mobile apps would be interesting) to induce behavioural change towards increased cyber awareness/more cyber-wise computer use in people (could be generic users, or perhaps a specific type of user groups such as older adults, or else employees in an organisation). Secondly, you could investigate the design and implementation of a prototype mechanism for carrying out such a change, and potentially (thirdly) evaluate your solution.

      - For this project, a thorough investigation into all aspects of cyber security (from technical to human and cultural aspect) has to be done. In particular, the U.K.’s cyber security strategy has to be explained and discussed. A case study will be added, that describes a recent
    - Project  #wfe-count -- "Smart Phone Malware and its Taxonomies" #h3
      - Smartphone malware is studied with a view to developing a taxonomy to guide victims in the resolution of issues resulting from an attack. The study focusses on the principles of business context, user and content; in the business context malware is classified according to its purpose, while the user taxonomy is based on user behavior (customers, employees and individuals) and content uses the conventional taxonomy for malware and the source of content.  On the basis of this study a suitable taxonomy for smartphones is recommended.
    - Project  #wfe-count -- "KFG Wireless Penetration Test" #h3
      - With the rapid advancement of wireless, organizations and individuals have become ever more dependent on this technology, steering attackers’ attention from wired to wireless networks. This dissertation reports a wireless penetration test of the Kingston Financial Group (KFG) network, with a view to identifying security flaws and vulnerabilities. These are categorized according to their severity levels using a range of risk scoring methods. Both short and long term actions are proposed to mitigate these vulnerabilities
    - Project  #wfe-count -- "IP Security Protocol: A Practical Investigation" #h3
      - This dissertation presents a study of practical IP security and the use of virtual device software and virtual private networks. The mechanisms of IPSec are investigated with respect to the provision of authentication, integrity and confidentiality through cryptographic algorithms, certificate infrastructures, the effective placement of IPSec functionality and the management and storage of cryptographic keys. The practical issues of design, configuration and implementation are investigated in a Packet Tracer simulation.
    - Project  #wfe-count -- "Quantum Key Exchange: An Emulator for BB84" #h3
      - BB84 is a protocol for Quantum Key Exchange (QKE) which uses photon polarization to transfer key information between communicating parties in the form of quantum bits (qubits). This dissertation explores the fundamental theory and literature relating to BB84, before emulating its action in a web application for short message exchange. It also scrutinizes the factors affecting key exchange such as eavesdropping and noise which are presented as test cases. The dissertation concludes with a review of ongoing work in Quantum Computing.
    - Project  #wfe-count -- "Security and Usability in Mobile" #h3
      - This project introduces and discusses aspects of Mobile Usable Security. Usability, which focuses on ease-of-use (as defined by speed, efficiency, learnability, memorability and user preferences) was once considered the polar opposite of security, but over the past two decades the areas of Computer Security and Human Computer Interaction (HCI) have become aligned as "Usable Security". However, it is agreed that the systems currently in use will eventually suffer significant failure; only by simultaneously addressing both usability and security concerns will the designer and developer be able to build systems that are both genuinely secure and usable.
    - Project  #wfe-count -- "Ready To Change, Achieving Improved Cyber Security Behaviour using Gamification"  #h3
      - While cyber security monitors and responds to threats in cyberspace, it relates to diverse domains and fields such as physical security, network security, security assessment and human elements such as social, psychological and machine-interaction. However, it is agreed that sound security technology can only be implemented if a healthy security culture is present; in particular, individuals’ levels of cyber-awareness will determine the significance of vulnerabilities, e.g. the following of e-mail phishing links, the opening of executable artefacts or the perpetration of ‘salami slicing’ fraud. This project aims to use known game mechanics to create effective changes in users’ security behaviour. To this end, the concept of gamification is reviewed and a prototype system developed. An implementation using standard web technologies such as PHP, MySQL, HTML and CSS is described.
    - Project 1 : "Design of secure and usable information systems – AEGIS as a methodology"
      - The aspects of usability and human factors tend to be neglected in secure system design. In this thesis, the AEGIS methodology for the improvement of both secure and usable systems is studied. A review of the literature on security design and human computer interaction in security (HCISec) sets the scene, followed by a description of the methodology. A user study based on questionnaires is conducted in order to understand typical factors impacting on security and usability, in the opinion of users. A focus on secure but memorable passwords concludes the thesis.
    - Project 2 : "Evaluation of various vulnerability and penetration testing tools and methodologies"
      - Cyber security is of growing importance in today's world of interconnected computers, devices, appliances and many other items. Security measures such as risk analysis and vulnerability assessment must be applied at all layers of an IT infrastructure, to protect assets or mitigate damage caused by cyber attacks. This dissertation compares and contrasts manual and automatic vulnerability assessment techniques in terms of their effectiveness, based on conducting practical activities in a virtual environment. Furthermore, a detailed review of vulnerability assessment and scanning tools will be carried out, informing the testing sessions. Professional readers, the main audience of this thesis, will be encouraged to invest into cyber security in general and vulnerability assessment in particular, through the reported results.
    - Project 3 : " Secure Architectures for Accessing Hybrid Cloud and Applying Multi-Secret Sharing Scheme"
      - An architecture is proposed to provide SMEs with scalability, cost reduction, system availability and security. A hybrid cloud infrastructure is replicated across multiple data centres to grant end-users access to the Internet while isolating the MPLS domain to reduce the attack surface available to any intruder. The thesis also shows how different WAN technologies can become part of a single MPLS layer 3 VPN domain, and presents a novel solution to the implementation of confidentiality by applying a combination of multi-secret sharing, homomorphic encryption and digital signatures.
    - Project 4 : "Investigating Secure Fall Detection System in the Internet of Things (IoT)"
      - Many devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) are lacking security and privacy of confidential data that is shared between humans, systems and networks. This is particularly crucial if health-related IoT scenarios are considered, where the safety of patients may be at risk. In this thesis, a Raspberry Pi-based fall detection health application that uses a 3-Axis accelerometer to monitor and detect an elderly person fall is devised and secured with respect to communication between the detection device and a twitter feed, received by caregivers or family members. A ThingSpeak cloud server is used to securely store an audit trail of the generated communication. A simulation of the system is carried out as a proof-of-concept solution.
    - Project 5 : "The Privacy and Security of Blockchain Technology for the Internet of Things"
      - The Internet of Things (IoT) is the universe of networked devices, equipped with sensors, exchanging information between each other and allowing humans to control complex environments with little interaction. Blockchain technology, another emerging technology, provides distributed and authenticated storage of information, for a range of use cases and scenarios. In this thesis, the idea of using blockchain technology for storing information relating to IoT applications is explored, focussing on resulting privacy and security aspects. An in-depth literature review on blockchain security will be presented, followed by a discussion of security challenges and solutions specific to the IoT. This includes implications brought by the General Data Protection Regulation (GTPR). A feasibility study based on integrating IoT devices with a modified Ethereum private blockchain further illustrates the identified security issues and their potential solutions.
    - Project 6 : "Data Collection and Protection through IoT and Secret Sharing "
      - In response to the demands of “Big Data”, a novel method of data collection and protection was developed based on the Internet of Things (IoT), secret sharing and cloud computing. Data were collected by the Raspberry Pi and uploaded with cryptographic protection to four cloud platforms: ThingSpeak, Carriots, Beebotte, and Firebase. While secret sharing prevented any of these platform having access to the complete data, recombined timestamp-sorted shares from multiple platforms allowed data to be reconstructed, integrity-checked and further analysed by MATLAB.

    - Project 7 : "Preventing and defending against virtual machine escapes in a virtualised environment"
      - The virtualisation paradigm dates as far back as the 1960s, and is nowadays an effective means of convenience and cost saving for a range of organisations, thanks to the invention of cloud computing. At the heart of virtualisation is the hypervisor, which is software running in privileged mode on the host operating system.
      - This thesis researches security aspects of hypervisors, with a focus on software vulnerabilities. After reviewing different types of such vulnerabilities, a focus is on exploits escaping from the hypervisor sandbox. Some recently documented vulnerabilities will be described and analysed in detail. Using practical experiments  in a simulated environment, the feasibility of reproducing exploits will be investigated.
      - Finally, recommendations will be given how to prevent security attacks targeting hypervisors, including practical advice for cloud-provider organisations wishing to strengthen the security of their systems.
    - Project 8 : "Analysing the Use of Threshold Signature Schemes in Bitcoin Wallets to Increase Bitcoin Adoption "
      - Cryptocurrencies on a whole have experienced significant growth in adoption and value since Bitcoin’s creation. Many cryptocurrency owners, however, have been the target of massive heists over the years and there is no indication of criminals being slowed down. Blockchain is a technology that many understood to have promised unbreakable security. The question of why so many thefts take place must be asked. This thesis provides a broad and deep look at Bitcoin, blockchain, the cryptographic techniques that underly them, and the expectations of those who created and use cryptocurrencies today. Next, it reviews a novel threshold cryptographic protocol that was created with the intention to overcome some of Bitcoin’s biggest security challenges and provides analysis of whether the original goal was accomplished.
    - Project 9 : "Application of Artificial Intelligence in Real-Time Cyber Defence"
      - Cyber security is considered as one of the key global issues of the 21st century and a secure IT environment is essential for any organisation to operate reliably and safely. As the nature of cyber attacks is constantly changing, research into next-generation Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) aims at improving the capabilities of defence to learn through experience and adapt with knowledge gained over time. This thesis evaluates the effectiveness of currently available AI-based IDS/IPS solutions for an enterprise. After a comprehensive review of AI-based IDS/IPS techniques and an up-to-date survey of products, a substantial feasibility study within a network environment of a real organisation is undertaken, comparing an Open Source and commercial tool. The evaluation is based on conducting a number of practical activities combining manual and automatic simulated attack techniques. The results are discussed and recommendations are derived.

        - Project 7 : "Preventing and defending against virtual machine escapes in a virtualised environment"
          - The virtualisation paradigm dates as far back as the 1960s, and is nowadays an effective means of convenience and cost saving for a range of organisations, thanks to the invention of cloud computing. At the heart of virtualisation is the hypervisor, which is software running in privileged mode on the host operating system.
          - This thesis researches security aspects of hypervisors, with a focus on software vulnerabilities. After reviewing different types of such vulnerabilities, a focus is on exploits escaping from the hypervisor sandbox. Some recently documented vulnerabilities will be described and analysed in detail. Using practical experiments  in a simulated environment, the feasibility of reproducing exploits will be investigated.
          - Finally, recommendations will be given how to prevent security attacks targeting hypervisors, including practical advice for cloud-provider organisations wishing to strengthen the security of their systems.
        - Project 8 : "Analysing the Use of Threshold Signature Schemes in Bitcoin Wallets to Increase Bitcoin Adoption "
          - Cryptocurrencies on a whole have experienced significant growth in adoption and value since Bitcoin’s creation. Many cryptocurrency owners, however, have been the target of massive heists over the years and there is no indication of criminals being slowed down. Blockchain is a technology that many understood to have promised unbreakable security. The question of why so many thefts take place must be asked. This thesis provides a broad and deep look at Bitcoin, blockchain, the cryptographic techniques that underly them, and the expectations of those who created and use cryptocurrencies today. Next, it reviews a novel threshold cryptographic protocol that was created with the intention to overcome some of Bitcoin’s biggest security challenges and provides analysis of whether the original goal was accomplished.
        - Project 9 : "Application of Artificial Intelligence in Real-Time Cyber Defence"
          - Cyber security is considered as one of the key global issues of the 21st century and a secure IT environment is essential for any organisation to operate reliably and safely. As the nature of cyber attacks is constantly changing, research into next-generation Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) aims at improving the capabilities of defence to learn through experience and adapt with knowledge gained over time. This thesis evaluates the effectiveness of currently available AI-based IDS/IPS solutions for an enterprise. After a comprehensive review of AI-based IDS/IPS techniques and an up-to-date survey of products, a substantial feasibility study within a network environment of a real organisation is undertaken, comparing an Open Source and commercial tool. The evaluation is based on conducting a number of practical activities combining manual and automatic simulated attack techniques. The results are discussed and recommendations are derived.

          - Latest Trends in Mobile Security
            - The rapidly emerging field of mobile security is to be explored for this project. A precise definition of the domain, including typical security threats and vulnerabilities, will be developed. The project would be complemented by an implementation or simulation of a basic app that includes some security features.
          - Security Management and Assessment Taxonomy
            - When assessing the security of an organisation, security management and assessment are vital techniques to achieve confidentiality, integrity and availability of key assets. A great number of different frameworks have been suggested in the literature, and in this project you will give an overview and critical analysis and comparison of the individual methodologies. An additional contribution would be the application of a particular method to a real (or fictitious) scenario.

            - Overview
              - Computer, network and cyber security are increasingly attracting attention by the popular media, mirroring their growing importance for everyday computer use by both individuals and organisations. Whilst cyber security can be defined as the assessment of, responding to and monitoring of the security of the cyberspace, it is difficult to pin down to one single scientific discipline, but rather relates to a number of domains and fields such as physical security, network security, security assessment frameworks and the human element.
              - It is commonly agreed in the literature that sound security technology can only be designed, implemented and used if a healthy security culture is present throughout these different stages. In particular, cyber-awareness of individual users will determine their behaviour and create typical vulnerabilities such as following links sent via email and other channels, e.g. Skype and whatsapp, opening PDFs or  installing software such as executables and browser toolbars that may create software vulnerabilities. Consequently, individuals will be exposed to a great range of cyber security threats, for example 'long cons' as intensive and sustained attempt to achieve a substantial exploit, or 'short cons' such as getting children to click on a link that charges their parents' phone.
              - Hence, an important security control this the ensuring of security responsible behaviour through behavioural change frameworks, which are the focus of this dissertation project.
            - Aims and Objectives
              - The overarching aim of the project is to find mechanisms, frameworks, tools and applications (in particular, "gamification" using mobile apps) to induce behavioural change towards increased cyber-awareness and more cyber-wise computer use in people. This could be generic users, or perhaps a specific type of user group such as older adults, or employees in an organisation.
              - The following objectives are proposed:
              -   - To thoroughly review the literature of proposed behavioural change methods in the context of cyber-awareness. This review will include disciplines such as psychology, behavioural science and HCI.
              -   - To create a framework for behavioural change to cyber-wise/cyber awareness, based on the established model (KU)
              -   - To investigate the design and implementation of a prototype mechanism for carrying out such a change
              -   - Potentially to evaluate the solution.
            - The aims of the project are to first of all investigate mechanisms, frameworks, tools and applications (in particular, "gamification" using mobile apps would be interesting) to induce behavioural change towards increased cyber awareness/more cyber-wise computer use in people (could be generic users, or perhaps a specific type of user groups such as older adults, or else employees in an organisation). Secondly, you could investigate the design and implementation of a prototype mechanism for carrying out such a change, and potentially (thirdly) evaluate your solution.

          - Cloud Security Using Secret Sharing
            - For this project, a comprehensive review of the area of cloud security will be given. This will include traditional and novel threats, vulnerabilities and controls. Also, suitable threat modelling techniques could be investigated. In order to achieve a very good mark, a simulation or implementation of a basic private cloud will be carried out.

        - Placements
          - We have been able to make provision within our budget in relation to recruiting two cyber security interns into our cyber security team. We are in the progress of developing the job description for these roles and hope to begin recruitment in February. As discussed these roles would be an open competition but it is likely that the job description will make reference to requiring qualifications such as an NCSC-certified Master’s and Bachelor's degrees in cyber security and closely related fields.
        - Projects
          - Further to our discussion regarding possible projects to collaborate on, we have developed a number of possible titles/themes which we would very much like to discuss with you. We have divided them into what we consider larger project questions with teams of students participating and topics which could perhaps be worked up into individual dissertation topics. However, this is all very much open for discussion however these are focused very much on the emerging challenges that we are facing as a regulator.
        - Project topics
          - Drones and Cyber Security: As digitally connected devices drones are both potential targets for cyber-attack and potential cyber-attack vectors. What are the current cyber security solutions and standards operating within the consumer drones market and what solutions and standards (if any) should the regulators require to effectively  mitigate security and safety risks?
          - Black box Challenge: A critical component of regulation is understand the causes of undesirable events and the ascribing of responsibility for the causes of those events. This can be a particular challenge where decisions are made by autonomous systems utilising artificial intelligence or machine learning. Regulators therefore need to understand (i) the risk profile presented by these technologies (ii) how technical mitigations can assist in reviewing decision-making processes and (iii) how to apportion responsibility for these decisions. What potential solutions exist to these challenges?
          - Regulation through Artificial Intelligence: Artificial Intelligence can provide significantly enhanced capabilities to monitor the performance of systems (both real-world and digital) for regulatory purposes. What technical mitigations exist to deliver this within the aviation sector and how could be utilised to improve (i) the quantitative and qualitative data available to and (ii) decision-making making by regulators, with particular reference to the aviation sector.
          - Smart Aviation: Aerodromes and Air Navigation Service Providers have increasingly complex, interconnected and interdependent systems often incorporating both new and legacy systems. Mapping and monitoring the extent of and relationships between these systems is challenging, particularly as some mapping techniques could result in the interruption of safety and operationally critical services. What possible solutions could be considered to these challenges? To what extent could machine-learning driven tools be used in these processes?
        - Dissertation topics
          - Cloud Services: Both safety and operationally critical aviation systems are increasingly hosted in the cloud how does this (i) to what extent does this increase an entity’s risk profile and (ii) what visibility and control tools could be considered to mitigate any increased risks?
          - DDOS and the IoT: How vulnerable is aviation infrastructure to DDOS attacks, both as the target of an attach and through the increased presence of IoT devices within their systems as a participant?
