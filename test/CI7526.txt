		- Motivation #CI7130_Intro #CI6240_proto1 #slide #CI7160-intro #basic #CI7110 
			- We are all concerned, but we don't always understand the threats, how possible solutions are designed -- and how we can use them to protect ourselves.
			- Who of you has been affected by computer security incidents? 
			- Discussion:
				- What are typical threats in computer security?
				- What is computer security? What are the different fields in the security domain?
				- What are recurrent challenges, and how can you contribute?

		- Current Security Challenges #slide #CI7130_Intro  #basic
			- Scale of the problem is widely underestimated
			- Nature of the threats often unknown, even to IT professionals
			- Security policies are not sufficiently well-developed

		- The Goals of Computer Security #slide #CI7100 #CI7160-intro #CI7130_Intro #basic #CI6280 
			- We will define as the main goals (or requirements) of Computer Security (“CIA”):
				- Confidentiality
				- Integrity
				- Availability
			- This terminology is adopted by academia and industry
			- Note: cannot “guarantee” absolute security
		- Threats, Vulnerabilities and Controls #slide #CI7100 #CI7160-intro #CI7130_Intro #basic #CI6280 
			- Threat: set of circumstances with potential to exploit vulnerability and create a risk of harm
			- Vulnerability: potentially exploitable weakness of an asset
			- Attack: realisation of a threat ("threat event")
			- Risk: occurs if “matching” threat and vulnerability exist
			- Control: a mitigation technique, either eliminate the threat and/or close the vulnerability
		- Basic Security Methodology #slide #CI6240_SM-1 #CI7100 #CI7160_D1 #CI7130_Intro #basic #CI6280 
			- The basic methodology in computer security is:
				- We detect uncovered vulnerabilities in our system
				- We think about potential threats to our system
				- Finally, we consider available controls (countermeasures)
			- Impossible to guarantee security, can only minimise risk
			- Need for periodic review
	- BASIC #linear #basic #wfe-ignore-item 
		- Assets #CI7100 #CI7130_Intro #slide #CI7160-intro #basic 
			- In order to better understand security attacks, we have to define what we want to protect
			- This is called an asset
			- We categorise assets in the following way:
				- System (logical)
				- Hardware
				- Software
				- Data
				- People
		- Assets #slide #CI7100 #CI7130_Intro #CI6240_SM-1 #basic 
			- ![assets.png](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wy569h036gsfa0v/assets.png?dl=1) #wfe-style:normal 
		- Mini-Exercise: Assets #slide #CI7100 #CI7130_Intro #basic 
			- Look around you. There are many assets of the Kingston University system present. List some asset items, with at least one in each category. 
			- Which of them do you consider being critical assets -- these would be assets of particular value or importance for your student experience.
		- The Goals of Computer Security #slide #CI7100 #CI7160-intro #CI7130_Intro #basic 
			- We will define as the main goals (or requirements) of Computer Security (“CIA”):
				- Confidentiality
				- Integrity
				- Availability
			- This terminology is adopted by academia and industry
			- Note: cannot “guarantee” absolute security
		- Confidentiality #slide #CI7100 #CI7160-intro #CI7130_Intro #basic 
			- Definition: computer related assets must be accessed only by authorised parties
			- Synonyms: secrecy, privacy
			- Example: you need to prevent hackers from accessing personal data in your social network account
			- There may be different levels of confidentiality for different users
		- Integrity #slide #CI7100 #CI7160-intro #CI7130_Intro #basic 
			- Data Integrity:
				- Data has not been modified by unauthorised parties
				- Example: file transfer, email, computer viruses
			- Origin Integrity (Authentication):
				- We have proof about origin of a message
				- Example: IP address of the machine the e-mail was sent from
			- Non-repudiation:
				- Sender (or recipient) of a message cannot deny having been involved in message transfer
				- This is more complex (usually involves 3 parties)
		- Availability #slide #CI7100 #CI7160-intro #CI7130_Intro #basic 
			- Definition: assets are accessible to authorised parties at appropriate times
			- In other words: legitimate access should always be possible
			- Example: a website should be available 24/7.
			- Different availability levels

		- Threats, Vulnerabilities, Attacks and Risks #slide #CI7100 #CI7160-intro #CI7130_Intro #basic 
			- Threat: set of circumstances with potential to exploit vulnerability and create a risk of harm
			- Vulnerability: potentially exploitable weakness of an asset
			- Attack: realisation of a threat ("threat event")
			- Risk: occurs if “matching” threat and vulnerability exist
		- Controls #slide #CI7100 #CI7160-intro #CI7130_Intro #basic 
			- A control is used for protection.
			- It could be for example an
				- action,
				- procedure,
				- device,
				- technique.
			- It either eliminates the threat and/or closes the vulnerability.
			- Controls need to be effective.
		- #todo Basic Security Methodology #slide #CI6240_SM-1 #CI7100 #CI7160_D1 #CI7130_Intro #basic 
			- The basic methodology in computer security is:
				- We detect uncovered vulnerabilities in our system
				- We think about potential threats to our system
				- Finally, we consider available controls (countermeasures)
			- Impossible to guarantee security, can only minimise risk
			- Need for periodic review
		- Generic Security Methodology #slide #CI7160-intro 
			- For each critical asset do:
				- Identify potential threats
				- Detect uncovered vulnerabilities
				- Assess potential risks
				- Design controls (countermeasures)
			- Constant re-evaluation is necessary
				- Anticipate potential new threats (for example: http://www.cert.org)
				- Identifies areas where more work is needed
				- Review existing controls
				- Monitor technological progress
		- Mini-Exercise: Security Goals #slide:mini #CI7100 #CI7130_Intro #basic 
			- Read the story about the recent security incident at [The Register](https://www.theregister.co.uk/security/).
			- Analyse the story more in-depth (you may have to research older, related articles) and identify which of the main security goals were violated, and of which (critical) assets.
